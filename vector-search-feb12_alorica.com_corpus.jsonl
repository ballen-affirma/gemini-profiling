{"_id": "doc_98", "title": "What Marketing Executives Need to Know About Adopting AI Technology", "text": "https://alorica.com/news/detail/what-marketing-executives-need-to-know-about-adopting-ai-technology\nHome\nIn The News\nWhat Marketing Executives Need to Know About Adopting AI Technology\nWhat Marketing Executives Need to Know About Adopting AI Technology\nPublished on August 9, 2019\nShare this\nAs consumers, we interact with artificial intelligence daily, likely without giving it much thought. Netflix recommends your next binge based on the show you watched last night. Amazon convinces you to buy three more items that align with your buying habits. And ride-share apps like Uber or Lyft analyze your location and connect you with a driver heading your direction. When AI makes everyday tasks easier, the consumer experience feels seamless.\nBut for many business and marketing leaders AI is the buzzword du juor keeping them up at night. Executives often feel like they should be doing more in the space but struggle with knowing where to start. If you're considering whether and to what extent to weave AI technology into your business strategy, here are some factors to consider.\n1) Weigh ROI before building anything.\n\"There\u2019s this assumption that you have to build highly specialized, custom machine learning models on your own. In fact, that\u2019s usually not the best thing to do,\" says Will Thompson, managing director of thought leadership and publisher of the award-winning Forbes AI. For most business needs, partnering with a cloud service provider to leverage pre-trained models is the better bet. Considering return on investment can help guide your strategy. Ask yourself, \"How much more accurate do you think you're going to get with your predictions about your customers using AI, at what cost and for what return?\" Thompson recommends. \"You really need to keep that idea in plain sight or else you risk throwing a lot of money down a rat hole.\"\n2) Tackle process automation first. When deciding where to start, Alorica Chief Marketing Officer Colson Hillier recommends focusing on back-office processes first. Identify the repeatable tasks that can benefit from a level of automation to make employees' jobs more efficient, he says. Using machine learning to automate tasks can make a significant impact on your business, whereas user-facing applications such as voice interactions with customers are much more complex to implement.\n3) Test, learn and refine. \"It's rare that you open up or deploy an AI system and see an immediate benefit,\" Hillier says. Start small with a defined use case, apply metrics to measure success and refine your approach, he advises. Hillier\u2014whose company provides outsourcing services to help businesses scale and run more efficiently\u2014says AI needs to be supported within the executive ranks and at a strategic level for the long term. Rather than evaluating the technology as a trend that will fade or a box to check off, \"you really need to take a long view on AI.\" Though building out highly specialized talent, expensive systems, and organizing huge data sets can feel overwhelming, \"it is a core foundational capability that businesses in the next century need to embrace,\" Hillier says.\n4) Recognize consumer concerns. A recent research report from Pega revealed that consumers lack trust in AI technology's ability to make sound and ethical decisions. Less than 30% of respondents said they felt comfortable engaging with AI in customer service transactions. To overcome this challenge, businesses must ensure the value their offerings provide outweighs the trade-offs. \u201cConsumers will provide rights to utilize information and intelligence about themselves when they see that directly providing a benefit that outweighs their perceived risks,\u201d Alorica's Hillier says.\nMarketers within categories such as healthcare and financial services, which have heightened privacy sensitivities, should take extra caution when using consumer data to create AI solutions, Thompson says. Both Hillier and Thompson agree that algorithms shouldn't be left to run amok\u2014there has to be human intervention to limit potential problems.\nUltimately convenience will win consumers over. \"People don't buy products because of the label that's put on them or how the sausage is made,\" Thompson says. \"They buy something that is faster, cheaper or better.\"\nLike some of today's tech industry front-runners, \"The company that can find a way to use this technology to revolutionize their business model is going to win, and they\u2019re going to have an exponential advantage over their competitors,\" Thompson says. \"It ain\u2019t easy to get there, though.\u201d\nWritten by Krystal M.

NSAM spoke to Samasource and Alorica about what's happening and what still needs to be done.\nEthical business is now a core agenda for employees and, by consequence, companies around the world, with a drive to move beyond notions of corporate social responsibility. Even\u00a0the glamor of Silicon Valley is wearing thin, with workers now looking to companies perceived as doing good.\nOne area that is increasingly of interest is\u00a0impact sourcing, a socially responsible business process outsourcing\u00a0approach that benefits businesses, communities and individuals. Impact sourcing is growing in many parts of the world, including\u00a0Latin America and the Caribbean, and it is moving families and communities from poverty into the middle class.\nHeather Gadonniex, VP Marketing and Strategic Partnerships at\u00a0Samasource, says that companies like Samasource can deliver high quality digital services at competitive market rates, while\u00a0improving the lives of workers and their economies at large.\nSamasource specialises in image, video and sensor data annotation and validation for machine learning algorithms for applications from self-driving cars to smart hardware, and its social business model has helped over 50,000\u00a0people\u00a0move themselves out of poverty.\nThe Global 2000\u00a0spends\u00a0trillions of dollars\u00a0annually on goods and services. \u201cImagine if just 1% of this global spend went to impact sourcing. We believe this is where companies can \u2026 have the most positive impact on helping solve some of the world\u2019s greatest challenges and meeting sustainable development goals \u2013\u00a0using purchasing power for good,\u201d Gadonniex said.\nSamasource has focused on providing jobs in\u00a0AI\u00a0and data annotation specifically and currently employ over 2,800 workers. Through that network of 2,800, they believe they have positively impacted 50,000\u00a0people \u2013 workers and dependents \u2013\u00a0who have been able to move themselves out of poverty.\nGadonniex believes impact sourcing can be beneficial to Latin America and the Caribbean, if done right. She cites the example of Venezuelans who, following the economic collapse, have resorted to crowdsourcing platforms to find work such as data annotation within the AI industry.\nMicroworkers in countries like Venezuela\u00a0often earn very little. \u201cToo often companies take advantage of those most in need by contracting work and paying pennies on the dollar without adequate training, support and overall education,\u201d she said.\nShe cautions, though, that employment is not enough. \u201cImpact sourcing is only sustainable and beneficial for economies when workers are provided training\u00a0that leads to upskilling and career growth,\u00a0full-time employment, benefits, and a living\u00a0wage. In fact, currently, there are very few standards in place that address ethical digital procurement in the AI industry. This industry is in the early stages of understanding supply chain impacts, particularly as it relates to the procurement of training data annotation and labeling services \u2013 similar to where the apparel industry was over a decade ago.\u201d\nThis is exactly the approach that\u00a0Alorica\u00a0uses in its impact sourcing initiatives across the region, offering training and support to those from disadvantaged communities, without the expectation that they would necessarily work for Alorica.\nJose G. Ramirez, VP of Operations and Chief of Staff: LATAM and The Caribbean at Alorica, says: \u201cWe are creating a middle class in most of the countries that we are operating in in the region. We provide jobs that pay more than the average jobs in some markets. We have young people who make a better living than what their parents can afford just by working for companies like ours. We believe that we are creating change and also helping the local economies.\u201d\nRamirez stressed that impact sourcing is part of Alorica\u2019s DNA. \u201cIt is not only part of our values but it is also living up to our name. Our slogan is making lives better one interaction at a time, and that\u2019s what we are doing. I think it also builds a name for the brand in the region,\u201d he said.\nHe added that this has benefits for the company, including being able to not only source top talent but also to retain it, keep them engaged and to bond with the teams as a family, \u201cjust because we are doing the right thing.\u201d\n\u201cThat money coming from abroad changes economies. It\u2019s happening in Latin America and it is happening fast,\u201d Ramirez said. \u201cImpact sourcing is becoming more important in the different markets.\u201d\nNairim Avila,\u00a0Talent Acquisition Regional Director for LATAM at Alorica, explained that they partner with local organizations or government in different ways to support impact sourcing in those countries.\nIn\u00a0Jamaica\u00a0Alorica partnered with a local organization, which creates over 3,500 employment opportunities for disadvantaged populations. Alorica provided training to people from inner city communities in Kingston around contact center work.\n\u201cAfter the training, they were able to come to our site. Of those who came to our site, 24% applied for work and we hired 20 people out of those,\u201d Avila explains.\nFor\u00a0Guatemala\u00a0and\u00a0the Dominican Republic, Alorica is part of the BPO Cluster Association, which is also involved in impact sourcing. The Cluster sponsors some English language skills training and Alorica forms part of that language teaching. With all these initiatives, trainees do not have to pay any fees, and Alorica also often covers costs such as transportation and meal vouchers. Those who are trained are not obligated to work for Alorica, but can move into any part of the industry.\nIn this way, it is not just hiring people from particular communities; it is also about investing in those communities so that people have the skills, the expertise, the knowledge and the awareness to move into careers in the BPO industry.\nWhile most of Alorica\u2019s clients do not have a specific impact sourcing strategy, Ramirez says socially responsible business is a huge movement globally and the biggest brands want to work with vendors who want to do good. There are often unforeseen benefits too \u2013 particularly in terms of retention.\nWhile impact sourcing is not the only reason Alorica\u2019s attrition rates are so low, it is part of the equation. The company runs at sub 5% attrition, as a regional target. In really tough markets like Panama, where competition is high and unemployment is low, they are running at 4.6% monthly. In Jamaica, where there is high unemployment and a great deal of need, Alorica is running sub 3% monthly in some accounts. \u201cThe only accounts that skew that amount are the seasonal accounts for retail,\u201d Ramirez explains.\nThere are challenges to getting impact sourcing right. Ramirez says that more could be done if there was more support from local governments. \u201cSometimes it is difficult to coordinate these efforts with local government, even though we have support from local governments. It takes a lot of time to navigate through local government bureaucracy. Sometimes you are not allowed to do impact sourcing the way we want, because there is no political will.\u201d\nIt is also really hard to capture data around impact, in terms of the business and the communities. \u201cWe try to do what we can with the resources we have,\u201d Ramirez says. \u201cThere is just really no formula on getting impact right.\u201d\nWritten by Bianca Write, this article originally appeared in Nearshore Americas: http://bit.ly/2lGYWWs."}

Hint: Analytics, automation and cloud play big roles in CIOs\u2019 roadmaps.\u00a0 As the light dims on 2019, CIOs are turning their talents to the next legs of their digital journeys. Many IT leaders will augment their employee experience (EX) to improve the overall customer experience (CX). \u00a0 To wit, CIOs will focus on\ntalent, culture and organizational challenges in 2020.\u00a0\"CIOs will get a chance to step forward as business leaders, further developing their tech-driven innovation, people management, and ecosystem-building skills,\" according to\u00a0Forrester Research's CIO predictions report. \u00a0 Here IT leaders provide a sneak peek into what's on their IT roadmaps for 2020.\nData science and analyticsEnterprise data strategy continues to be a top initiative for CIOs, who see it as a necessary part of their firm\u2019s transformation plans. \u00a0 McKesson is ramping up its use of data beyond business intelligence to predictive and prescriptive analytics,\nwhich will improve the way the company ships pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, says Brian Dummann, the company\u2019s chief data and analytics officer. \u00a0 To prepare McKesson for this journey, Dummann has been consolidating several data warehouses\ninto a single Snowflake system running on Google Cloud Platform, which he says will help the company\u2019s employees move faster in meeting business needs. The end goal? Boosting patient outcomes. \u00a0 Also critical: Hiring more \u201canalytics translators\u201d\nwho can contextualize analytics for the business. \u201cBusiness domain knowledge is critical,\u201d Dummann says. \u201cWe want to advance the ball on our enterprise data capabilities.\u201d \u00a0 Industry domain experts who can break down data sets, understand how data\nflows and extract value from data are in hot demand, says Franzuha Byrd, CIO of consultancy MorganFranklin, which advises Fortune 500 companies on mergers and acquisitions, spin-offs and other corporate initiatives. \u00a0 Byrd pairs data scientists with\nindustry experts to hash out data management problems for clients, including how to automate transactions and mine data lakes for business insights.\u00a0\u00a0\u201c2020 will be a wake-up year, as the total cost of getting data right will become apparent,\u201d Forrester\nnoted in its 2020 CIO report.\nAI and machine learningOrganizations are adopting artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) for more targeted means. \u00a0 New York City\u2019s Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) is leveraging\u00a0natural language processing (NLP)\u00a0and ML capabilities to dynamically generate questions and better evaluate answers for takers of its exams, which the organization administers to the nearly 100,000 candidates for roles in the\npolice, fire and sanitation departments each year, according to CIO Nitin Patel. \u00a0 Currently, the questions follow rule-based, logic paths. By using NLP and ML, Patel will train algorithms to ask questions that are tailored to candidates applying\nfor various positions such as programmers, computer specialists and staff analysts. Ideally, such efforts would quicken an evaluation and scoring process that took as long as two years. \u00a0 Patel also hopes to leverage Amazon.com\u2019s Alexa or Google\u2019s\nvirtual assistant to create apps that help provide voice-based customer support, including the ability to ask questions via voice or text, saving humans from hours of tedious work. \u00a0 2020 will be the year of the omnichannel \u201csuperagent,\u201d an assistant\nthat caters to people for whom \u201cinstant gratification has become a reality,\u201d says Alorica Chief Transformation Officer Bhaskar Menon. \u00a0 Alorica, which supports business processes in call centers, is focused on improving Ava, a virtual assistant that\nanswers both the company\u2019s employees and customers\u2019 questions through text or voice-to-chat. Ava\u2019s accuracy rate is 86 percent, up from 70 percent from its launch. \u00a0 \u201cWe have to be omnipresent in whatever channel customers want,\u201d Menon says.\nCloud migrationsIron Mountain is banking on the cloud to help it manage digital content for media, entertainment and other data-rich sectors, part of a broad transformation away from its roots as caretaker for data stored via physical devices. \u00a0 The company, which\nuses machine learning to analyze and manage digital content on Google Cloud Platform, is also rolling out Google's G Suite collaboration software for 25,000 employees, says CTO Fidelma Russo, who is leveraging new technologies to help change the culture.\nHer strategy blends\u00a0cross-functional teams\u00a0leveraging modern processes and technologies. \u00a0 \"We're only at the\nbeginning of our digital transformation,\" Russo says. \"This is not something that we will get done in a year and move on to the next thing.\" \u00a0 Apparel retailer Talbots meanwhile is moving as much of its ecommerce and application infrastructure into\nthe cloud to reduce its reliance on on-premises equipment. The company is leveraging cloud software from Dynatrace to monitor its website and cloud systems for bugs, slow-downs and outages, says Don Hall, the company\u2019s manager of ecommerce operations.\nHall says that Talbots\u2019s business and IT staff can analyze conversion rates, average order volume and the number of shopping carts consumers create. \u201cIt makes my job much easier to have a tool to conglomerate data from business and IT into a single\nbucket,\u201d Hall says.\nLow-codeLow-code programming\u00a0is a strategic priority for Nutanix, as the technology company will train storage\nengineers, network engineers and other infrastructure experts to script and automate code as\u00a0citizen developers,\nsays CIO Wendy Pfeiffer, adding that low-code tools will help people reclaim their expertise as Nutanix moves further into the public cloud. \u00a0 The company has already trained some staff to use Workato, a popular low-code tool, which they use to express\ncode through optimal workflows and interactive design. But Pfeiffer anticipates ML will make it easier for citizen developers to improve suboptimal low-code scripts, further boosting the efficiency of business processes. \u00a0 \u201cI imagine a day where\nmore than half of our tasks performed by our ServiceNow service desk will handled by custom code developed through machine learning,\u201d Pfeiffer says.\nRPABusiness process efficiency is also a priority at company Zuora, where CIO Alvina Antar expects to use\u00a0robotic process automation (RPA)\u00a0to\nautomate mundane tasks for employees. This includes on-boarding and off-boarding end users of the company\u2019s billing and revenue management software. With RPA serving as a proxy for humans, Zuora could create self-service capabilities that enable end users\nto help themselves. \u00a0 Antar says that data and tools that make employees successful will trickle down to the CX. \u201cYears ago, we would just outsource support,\u201d Antar says. \u201cToday we can automate our way out of the need for end user support.\u201d\nCIOs will tweak their own departments by automating 10 percent of tasks, such as tier-one tech support and provisioning, with RPA and AI, according to Forrester. And they will upskill displaced personnel, helping support staff transition to more complex\ntasks within agile and DevOps teams, the researcher adds. \u00a0 Written by Clint Boulton, this article originally appeared in CIO: http://bit.ly/372XYGU"}

There\u2019s a consensus among financial experts that the markets are poised to pull back in the next 12-18 months. \u00a0 Driving this downturn is the fact that millennials\u2014the largest generation in the U.S. labor force\u2014are\nbuying houses and vehicles while contending with an enormous amount of student debt. In the past year alone, credit card loans have increased by 5%, and the percentage of seriously delinquent borrowers (90+ DPD) grew 11 basis points to 1.89%. \u00a0 Rather\nthan be caught off guard, many companies are taking steps now to prepare for the downturn. CEOs are tasking their leadership with implementing cost-saving initiatives, enhancing operational efficiencies and adapting to a pressure-driven economy.\nBeing proactive during tight financial times is paramount.

For candidates, consistent and informative communication offers them a better candidate experience, resulting in good reviews for your employer brand. And for recruiters, these communications\nhelp them better understand candidates, which allows them to find the role that suits candidates best. \u00a0 One communication avenue that\u2019s gaining traction among recruiters is social media, but according to our\u00a0annual recruiting survey, a majority of respondents (70%) claim they aren\u2019t encouraged to interact with candidates via social media. \u00a0 Furthermore, 74% say that social media interactions haven\u2019t been all that important\nin their recruiting process. This seems like a missed opportunity when it comes to finding top talent. And if you aren\u2019t convinced, maybe this case study from Facebook will change your mind.\nFacebook Messenger Reduces Cost Per HireAccording to a\u00a0Facebook blog post,\u00a0Alorica\u2014a global customer experience company with a strong\npresence in the Philippines\u2014\u201dused Messenger to create a smoother and more effective recruiting process for employees and candidates alike, reducing the cost per hire by 84%.\u201d \u00a0 In order to achieve this amazing metric, Alorica turned to Facebook Messenger\nwith the goal of creating a smarter, more efficient process to find and recruit candidates. The company\u2019s Philippines location is responsible for recruiting thousands of customer service positions across 17 Alorica locations every year, so finding a way\nto effectively communicate with candidates was vital. In order to make Messenger work for the company, Alorica partnered with\u00a0Talkpush, a recruitment platform compatible with Messenger. According\nto Facebook, \u201cThrough the Messenger and Talkpush integration, recruiters can screen, evaluate and hire candidates faster than ever before.\u201d \u00a0 The results of the integration were immediate! Alorica reports that it could handle simultaneous inquiries,\nprovide real-time responses, and conduct initial screenings\u2014all through Facebook Messenger. \u201cEven better, the team could do it 24/7, which drastically increased the number of candidates they could assess and hire,\u201d says the blog post.\nIt Also Allows for More In-Depth Interviews and Saves TimeYou may be thinking, \u201cWhat\u2019s so special about Messenger? I use the same app to talk to my aunt in California.\u201d Let Alorica convince you otherwise! According to Facebook, Alorica is also able to conduct in-depth question-and-answer sessions with applicants\nthrough Messenger. \u201cRecruiters can access candidates\u2019 responses and follow up with next steps by phone, which keeps candidates excited about the process and increases the likelihood of an in-person interview,\u201d says Facebook. \u00a0 Remember that cost-per-hire\nmetric we mentioned earlier? By integrating Talkpush and Messenger, Alorica was able to interview 3,000 candidates in just 3 months. It used to take the company that long just to find 900 candidates! By utilizing this technology, the recruiters were able\nto save over 12,000 hours of work and saw an increase of 15% in conversion rates compared with the 5% traditional methods produced. \u00a0 If you\u2019ve been convinced and want to start communicating with candidates via Messenger today,\u00a0check out this article, which will walk you through the process of integrating your company\u2019s Facebook business page with the Messenger app. \u00a0 Written by Melissa Morse, this article originally appeared in HR Daily Advisor:\nhttp://bit.ly/2QXLytW"}
{"_id": "doc_103", "title": "AI in Hiring Gets Companies More Talent, Faster", "text": "https://alorica.com/news/detail/ai-in-hiring-gets-companies-more-talent-faster\nHome\nIn The News\nAI in Hiring Gets Companies More Talent, Faster\nAI in Hiring Gets Companies More Talent, Faster\nPublished on January 28, 2020\nShare this\nThrough processes like automated candidate sourcing and candidate rediscovery, AI sifts through many resumes to find those most suited to a position.\u00a0 The use of machine learning and AI in hiring remains limited despite great potential. Companies\nhave been hesitant to embrace the technology but are increasingly seeking ways in which AI can improve their recruitment and retention in a competitive job market. \u00a0 A recent HR.com survey identified locating, acquiring and keeping candidates as\nmajor challenges in the hiring and retention process. On average, companies would not rehire 31% of their recent hires if given the chance to do it again. \u00a0 Only about one quarter of the surveyed companies report that their recruitment technologies\nmet their current hiring needs to a high or very high extent. Companies also expressed their desire to minimize time spent sorting through resumes and finding a proper list of candidates. Both issues can be addressed through the utilizing AI in hiring\nprocedures.\nBring the right candidates in Through processes like automated recruiting\u00a0the field can be whittled down\u00a0to\na more manageable number of candidates. Companies can couple this with a process known as candidate rediscovery in which an algorithm can sort through people who have shown interest in similar positions before and select those who are a viable option\nfor the new role. \u00a0 Typically, the process of locating and narrowing down a field of candidates is the most arduous of the entire process. This is where AI can and should be implemented, but with at least some human involvement. \u00a0 \"Machines\ncan quickly narrow a wide array of outcomes and data down to a handful of choices,\" Will Hayes, CEO of Lucidworks, an enterprise search technology company based in California, said. \u00a0 Allowing the more tedious tasks to be handled by AI in hiring\nnot only permits employees to focus on other tasks but these algorithms and chatbots can handle larger candidate fields in less time, an advantage in a competitive market.\nRainerio Borja, President of Alorica Asia Pacific, has seen the introduction of AI in his company and its usage in recruitment. For Alorica, the usage of AI works to supplement their recruiting process and ease the burden on employees.\n\"We implement technology to free up our employees to focus on more complex and customized tasks, while AI handles the simple, repetitive ones,\" Borja said.\nGet to them faster The job market is flying -- there are often more positions than there are job candidates. Companies seeking employees must quickly provide a worthy offer, or they risk losing out. \u00a0 \"Speed is critical. One of the\nthings that machine learning can do is get you to hire faster,\" Dr. John Sullivan, HR thought leader and author, said. \"The top people are going to be gone in 10 days.\" \u00a0 One solution to this increased need for rapid acquisition are chatbots. These\ncan locate potential job candidates for open positions in much less time than a human alternative. Turning to\u00a0chatbots to help locate\u00a0interested\nand proper candidates leads to better options when it comes to filling open positions. \u00a0 \"By utilizing chatbots to initially screen candidates, it has allowed us to cut down on the time that it takes to determine if an applicant qualifies for the\nnext round of interviews,\" Borja said. The traditionally lengthy process can therefore be cut down with AI and potentially provide more suitable candidates.\nFinding the needle The usage of chatbots and\u00a0machine learning\u00a0can find jobseekers who may have been passed up by\nprevious methods. In new companies or those with shifting priorities, the traditional ideas of seeking the candidate with the most education or experience has changed. As Sullivan sees it, those individuals who don't have a degree but who have a body\nof work within a certain field may have been passed by when using traditional methods. AI can be tuned to count candidate's abilities rather than formal education. \u00a0 The technology is only as capable as the data and parameters it is given. Traditional\nmarkers of success and capability may not be as representative as once thought -- now, higher intelligence and general cognitive ability are the\u00a0best determinants\u00a0of\njob performance, rather than education specifics. It would therefore be necessary for companies to tweak their AI to look for these when it hunts for candidates and that these companies track the details behind successful hires and unsuccessful ones.\nDespite the advances in technology, only a small percentage of companies utilize performance data when it comes to their hiring process according to Sullivan. If you don't track what made candidates succeed and what did not and then inform your\nmachine learning algorithm to look for the successful qualities, then it will just repeat mistakes.\nWhat the future of hiring and HR looks like The adoption of change and embracing of AI in hiring has been slow to this point, but the potential benefits are still there. The process requires the data and companies must track the performance\nof hires (retention, effectiveness, cultural fit) and compare where these optimal performers came from. They must be able to understand what makes a good candidate when it comes to the company they run. Who has succeeded, who has struggled and what do\nthe positive candidates have in common? \u00a0 AI, machine learning and\u00a0numerous other technologies\u00a0can\nhelp with that, as well as improve the speed of hiring and ease the burden on their current employees. \u00a0 \"Deploy AI projects iteratively, where you can take bite-sized chunks with measurable outcomes to ensure you don't over-promise and under-deliver,\"\nHayes said. \"Focus on the small victories and they'll inevitably lead to a major positive impact.\" \u00a0 Written by Joseph M.

She has been living on disability benefits since. \u00a0 Now as the coronavirus pandemic\nupends the economy, Ms. Ervin, 46, has found a way to get back into the work force: She is answering customer service calls for a regional retail chain. \u00a0 Call centers have had to adapt swiftly because the pandemic has dealt them a double blow. They\nare fielding more calls from customers inquiring about online orders or seeking refunds or forbearance. But many of the people who would normally answer those calls either can\u2019t get to work or are not equipped to work from home. \u00a0 The transition\nhas been messy; industry executives say they are struggling to ship computers, headsets and other equipment to employees. Many customer service representatives, who earned\u00a0a median income of $34,710 last year, also don\u2019t have internet connections fast enough to take calls and log in to corporate computer systems. In addition, companies said, they have had to shut down offices in countries like\nthe Philippines because of strict stay-at-home orders. \u00a0 Some companies, like Charter Communications, the telecom giant known as Spectrum, have come under fire for requiring workers to go to offices.\u00a0More than 230 Charter employees tested positive for Covid-19, and roughly half worked in offices or call centers, according to a person with knowledge of the company who was not authorized to speak publicly. A spokeswoman said\na \u201csignificant majority\u201d were now working from home. \u00a0 Many employers are seeking new workers wherever they can find them. One option is hiring people with disabilities. \u00a0 The\nNational Telecommuting Institute, a nonprofit that works with the Social Security Administration to fill telecommuting jobs with people who have\ndisabilities, has been approached by nearly a dozen additional companies seeking workers in the last three weeks. The institute has handled 30 percent more job postings over the past month than it did a year ago, and the numbers could be much higher in\nthe next month, said Alan Hubbard, the institute\u2019s chief operating officer. \u00a0 Founded in 1995, the telecommuting institute trains disabled people and helps them acquire the necessary equipment and broadband connections. The group also pairs beneficiaries\nwith mentors who help them update their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, prepare for interviews and make the transition to work. \u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re looking at this as tremendous opportunity to place people with disabilities into jobs,\u201d Mr. Hubbard said. \u201cRight now is the time companies\ncan fulfill the promise to the Americans With Disabilities Act.\u201d \u00a0 The institute is funded by government and business partnerships. Some companies outsource staffing, payroll and other human resource functions to the nonprofit. \u00a0 Ms. Ervin,\nwho lives in Sayre, Pa., found the telecommuting institute two years ago but didn\u2019t secure a job until March. She is now taking customer service calls for Meijer, a supermarket chain that operates in the Midwest and has worked with the institute since\n2005. \u00a0 \u201cI feel like I have some self-worth back,\u201d she said. Many of the calls she is fielding deal with online orders, which have spiked as people avoid shopping in stores. \u00a0 \u201cSince the Covid-19 crisis, N.T.I. has helped us to meet additional\ncustomer demand,\u201d Meijer said in a statement. \u201cWe have found they handle both basic and escalated customer emails and calls on Meijer\u2019s behalf on par or better than their peers.\u201d \u00a0 Call volumes are \u201coff the charts\u201d in several industries, including\nhealth care, insurance, technology and retail, said Michele Rowan, president of\u00a0Customer Contact Strategies, a consulting company\nthat specializes in remote work and call centers. \u00a0 Alorica, an outsourcing company that handles calls for large corporations, has had to temporarily shut down outposts in Guatemala, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica. Shelter-in-place orders and\ncurfews have prevented workers in those countries from going to work, and many can\u2019t work from home because they do not have computers and broadband internet connections. \u00a0 The company\u2019s U.S. operation is having to pick up that slack, said Colleen\nBeers, the president of North American and European operations. The company is trying to hire 8,000 people to keep up with demand. \u00a0 Call center work can be grueling, and some companies that employ lower-wage, lower-skilled workers have turnover\nrates of 30 percent to 45 percent. Some employers said the telecommuting institute\u2019s beneficiaries were less likely to quit. \u00a0 Erin Blunt, the president of VForce, which handles membership renewal, emergency roadside services and other calls for\nAAA, said her company hired 95 percent of its employees through the institute. \u201cN.T.I. is hiring people who really, truly want to work,\u201d she said. \u00a0 Benjamin Cargile, 43, landed a job with the bank PNC last month through the institute and hopes to\nkeep it for years. \u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t really like being on disability,\u201d said Mr. Cargile, who lives in Morrisville, N.C., and has received disability benefits since 2013 because of agoraphobia and other mental health issues. \u201cYou want to be able to support\nyourself.\u201d \u00a0 Workers like Mr. Cargile and Ms. Ervin were ready to start working because they already had the equipment and internet connections that call centers expect. That wasn\u2019t true of many people who already had call center jobs, Ms. Rowan\nsaid. \u00a0 Before the coronavirus, about 80 percent of call centers let some employees work from home at least some of the time, but only about 20 percent to 40 percent of workers did so, Ms. Rowan said. A survey of 108 call centers conducted by ContactBabel,\na research firm, found that 71 percent of their workers in the United States were working remotely in mid-April. \u00a0 Although call centers are considered essential businesses, many sent employees home because desks are typically spaced only three to\nfour feet apart. \u00a0 Alorica has sent 60 percent of its employees worldwide home to work. Of its 16,000 U.S. employees, 78 percent are home, Ms. Beers said. The transition was slow at first because the company had to coordinate with corporate customers\nto figure out what kind of equipment and internet access workers would need. In some cases, telecom companies couldn\u2019t get installers to homes fast enough to set up new connections. \u00a0 \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the opportunity for nine weeks to figure this\nout,\u201d Ms. Beers said. \u00a0 Some companies were able to move faster. ASK, a smaller call center operator based in Montgomery, Ala., told its agents to do speed tests on their home internet connections on March 9 and now has 430 of its roughly 450 employees\ntelecommuting, said Rick Burley, the company\u2019s president. \u00a0 The rest either prefer to work in the office or don\u2019t have broadband at home. Mr. Burley said ASK\u2019s office, a former bowling alley, allows the few employees still coming in to sit 30 to\nseveral hundred feet apart. \u00a0 Industry executives said they had noticed benefits from having employees work from home. For example, fewer employees are missing shifts, Ms. Beers said. \u00a0 \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have taken this to happen, frankly,\u201d Ms.\nRowan said. \u00a0 Tina Lewis, 48 started working for Live Response Solutions from her home in Portland, Ore., through the telecommuting institute in February. While it feels odd to benefit from the pandemic, said Ms. Lewis, who has fibromyalgia and peripheral\nneuropathy in her legs, she is grateful. \u00a0 \u201cHaving Social Security income \u2014 that\u2019s OK. But you\u2019re barely surviving,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need another way to survive, and being able to work from home makes that possible.\u201d \u00a0 Written by Jaclyn Peiser,\nthis article originally appeared in the New York Time:\u00a0nyti.ms/2VYTPRa"}

Moreover, since April 21, DWD has received more than 72,000 applications for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA).\nTo assist with calls and processing the extraordinary number of claims for unemployment benefits, DWD is working with two call center vendors and a processing and adjudication vendor:\nWith additional staff on board, DWD will extend its call center hours to 7:00 a.m.to 5:00 p.m. (hours were previously 7:35 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.). At 5:00 p.m., call center staff will stop accepting new calls, but will answer all calls remaining in the queue.\nCall Center Vendors\nAlorica will answer calls related to unemployment benefits. DWD began training over 55 Alorica staff this week who will begin answering calls upon completion of a week of accelerated training. When fully staffed, the Alorica call center is expected to have up to 500 work-at-home employees answering calls.\nBeyond Vision will employ 40 persons handling calls related to PUA applications and is scheduled to open on June 1.\nProcessing and Adjudication Vendor\nNelnet is dedicating approximately 100 people to process claims and at least 100 people to adjudicate claims. Training for Nelnet staff is anticipated to begin June 1.\nIn addition to the new call centers, DWD is currently recruiting new employees to fill more than 315 positions. Since the onset of COVID-19, the agency has been reassigning its own employees to the Unemployment Insurance (UI) Division and is in the process of receiving additional assistance from other state agencies to help with the enormous workload. Between external vendors, new hires, and transfers into UI, approximately 155 staff started the week of May 11, with approximately 230 more expected to start the week of May 18th.\n\"I'm incredibly appreciative and excited for the additional assistance our UI Division is getting from other DWD divisions, state agencies, and vendors,\" DWD Secretary Caleb Frostman said. \"We need all hands on deck to help the people of Wisconsin get the resources and financial support they need during the pandemic.\"\nTo further serve people, DWD implemented JARVIS, a chatbot software application for its website. Since the onset of COVID-19, in addition to the hundreds of thousands of calls it receives per day, DWD also receives thousands of emails to its general mailbox. JARVIS assists claimants to locate resources based on the information they provide. With more people using the chatbot to find answers already on DWD's website, DWD will have additional capacity to assist claimants with more complex issues.\nThis article originally appeared on the State of Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development site : https://bit.ly/3cTnLUI"}

The following is an edited transcript of their conversation.\nKaren Roby:\u00a0Where should companies be focusing right now, and explain why omnichannel communications should be a priority.\nColson Hillier:\u00a0I think that the idea of\u00a0omnichannel\u00a0is really about customer\nempowerment. Today, you think about the way that we interact with the brands that we love, and almost all of it involves multiple channels. I don\u2019t sit and watch TV any longer just by itself. I\u2019ve got my iPad up, and I\u2019m emailing,\nor texting, or using social networks. All those channels have a different sort of role to play in the overall customer experience. It\u2019s really important to get it right in terms of how you manage all of those channels in a way that\u2019s consistent\nand delivers an outcome for a customer that doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s coming from six different places. \u00a0 Our approach is to really look at that sort of opportunity on three different levels. The first is the application layer and making\nsure that you\u2019re relevant and available at all of the different apps that are used by customers to understand your products, or get information, or make purchases. The second is an intelligence layer where you\u2019ve got to apply a lot of\nthe logic and intelligence on how to manage that customer interaction. And the bottom layer is knowledge management. So, you need to work all three of these in order to deliver the right experience, but knowledge management essentially takes all of\nthe information that you need about product information, a customer\u2019s profile, and puts it in a place that is accessible via the cloud and is well-indexed so that it can be used in those omnichannel experiences. The intelligence layer looks\nat all that information and takes the content of a query, whether that\u2019s a social post, or a text, or a chat session or something like that, and it interprets that as the intent of the customer and delivers the knowledge that is needed to the\nclient through that application. \u00a0 If you can get those three things right, you can deliver an experience that feels very much aligned to where the customer wants to be met. There are different attitudes in social than you have when you\u2019re\nSMS-ing versus when you\u2019re on the phone with somebody. But the key is to make sure that you can manage that customer interaction across all of those channels in a way that\u2019s consistent and sort of respects the interaction or the investment\nthat the customer has made, either yesterday or earlier in the year, and give them an experience that\u2019s personalized and sort of builds on your history with them, as opposed to feeling like it comes from six different places.\nKaren Roby:\u00a0Expand a bit on the importance of agent-assisted artificial intelligence (AI) models.\nColson Hillier:\u00a0That core of being able to serve customers that have increasingly complex issues that they\u2019re trying to resolve in an environment where our businesses are changing, our\nclients\u2019 businesses are changing so rapidly, new product cycles, introductions, new policies and procedures. The pace of change is so great right now that it\u2019s almost impossible to train an employee on how to handle every situation that\nthey\u2019re going to come across in a classroom training, what we would call just-in-case training. \u00a0 A lot of where we focus our energy is on how do you take knowledge and use that at every stage of the agent life cycle to make sure that you\nhave the right information for the client or the end user at the point of need? To do that, you need to be able to have your insights and information to resolve problems or provide customer experience readily available. It needs to be indexed in a\nway that it can be delivered in context into a conversation so that an agent is able to easily find and deliver that content to a customer. \u00a0 We focused a lot on a couple of different things. One is that knowledge management layer\u2013we mentioned\nthat with omnichannel just a moment ago. The first way to deploy that is typically an agent-assist model. As you deploy an interface to an agent that\u2019s handling a customer service interaction and they\u2019re consistently utilizing this tool\nin order to access the content, and that content could come from the web, it could come from what we call tribal knowledge, so gathering all the intelligence of their peer groups, and supervisors, and things that typically were used on post-it notes\nor in notepads, and bringing that all together in a way that\u2019s easily indexed and searched and delivered to the agent in a consumable format. \u00a0 It can have a massive impact on the efficiency and the consistency of the delivery of a customer-service\nexperience. For example, when we looked at one of our clients, we started by evaluating all the calls they were taking. And we found that over 45% of the time an agent was on a call with a client, it was dead air time. And that time was spent researching\nand looking things up, it was asking a neighbor or a supervisor for some support, or generally processing things that were very low value to the customer interaction and really driving inefficiency in that interaction. So, when we deploy a knowledge\nmanagement solution, the agent has access to that information in real time and is able to get those responses delivered much more quickly. We see average handle time reduced by about 15%, we see what we call first-call resolution, or the ability to\nresolve a customer\u2019s issue the first time that they call in, increased by seven to nine points. \u00a0 These are really important metrics to the efficiency of how you deliver a customer experience through the call centers that we operate. The\nother important byproduct of having a platform like that is that it deploys AI and machine learning in a continued-improvement process. As I start to get questions, and I\u2019m interrogating this knowledge-management platform to get the answer,\nif that\u2019s the correct answer, I know that, and I sort of signal back on the affirmative. But if it\u2019s not, I\u2019m able to go back and have our knowledge engineers go back and understand why that was the case and tune the model so that\nit gets more effective. As you do this hundreds of thousands of times, you get to identify things that are repeatable and that you know you have high confidence in being able to deliver the response against. Those are the best candidates to take and\nmigrate into something that\u2019s fully automated, like a bot experience where humans are no longer required to deal with some of the types of questions that come up in our call center environments.\nKaren Roby:\u00a0What are your thoughts on automation?\nColson Hillier:\u00a0There\u2019s so many companies that have grown up, particularly larger companies, where processes that worked well at small scale, or when you had a very streamlined decision-making\nflow, or a limited number of systems that needed to be touched, worked just fine. But as you go through growth in your business and add new departments that are part of a chain or new systems that need to be updated and kept in sync with others, we\nfound that process automation is an awesome way to sort of thread together all of the disparities in a large ecosystem that needs to be managed in order to deliver an outcome. \u00a0 Whether it\u2019s something like a\u00a0back-office process automation\u00a0where you\u2019ve got an intake of a document that needs to be updated across four or five different systems and done consistently with high degrees of accuracy, or if it\u2019s a process\nthat is creating a lot of fallout or negative net promoter scores that you can address with systematic delivery, the process of understanding the end-to-end flow of information as it moves through a company, identifying where there are significant\nareas of fallout or inconsistency, or even very high resource allocation, like labor allocation, helps us to identify where there are opportunities to, again, deliver efficiency, consistency, and ultimately a better customer experience by solving\non speed and accuracy. \u00a0 This article originally appeared in TechRepublic:\u00a0https://tek.io/3ej2moB"}

Today I had the pleasure of\ntalking with Colleen Beers. \u00a0 With nearly 30 years of experience in strategic direction and operational processes, Colleen is President of North America and Europe Operations for Alorica, a global leader in customer experience solutions. In this\nrole, she is responsible for approximately 30,000 employees across the region, while managing operations to service many of the biggest clients in the world. Colleen is the embodiment of Alorica\u2019s promise of Passion, Performance, and Possibilities. She\nbegan her career on the frontlines, taking calls as an agent \u2014 and has worked her way up ever since. Colleen is also an influential leader on the Customer Contact Week Advisory Board and several women advocacy groups including Alorica\u2019s Women\u2019s Initiative.\nThank you so much for doing this with us! First, please tell us what brought you to this specific career path? \u00a0 Coming out of high school, I knew my calling in life was to help people. I moved to Texas from Pittsburgh to go to nursing\nschool and fulfill my purpose. To help pay for school and my car, I got a job at a call center when I was 19. And that job changed my life. \u00a0 A year in the job, I remember sitting in a focus group with other call center agents, senior leaders, and\nthe client we serviced. Our client was frustrated and wanted solutions to alleviate their customers\u2019 pain points, which is why we were having the focus group. Everyone was sitting there, quiet and intimidated. It wasn\u2019t just us agents who were nervous,\nbut also our leaders! So, I took a risk \u2014 I leaned in, spoke up, and gave my honest feedback and recommendations. \u00a0 A few hours later, I got called in to meet with the CEO, and I thought, \u201cthis is it \u2014 I went too far. I\u2019m getting fired!\u201d but instead,\nwe had a great conversation about the customer and agent experience, and he offered me a promotion right then and there, fast-tracking my participation in the company\u2019s management training program. The program then allowed me to work on rotation as a\nsupervisor in all areas \u2014 HR, IT, Recruiting, Training, Sales, Client Services, and more. It\u2019s through this experience that I learned there are so many ways to help people and empower them. It\u2019s also how I realized that the customer service industry was\nwhere I was meant to live out my life\u2019s mission. \u00a0 By 22, I was a Site Director overseeing 650 employees whom I could help earn a living, learn new skills, and grow in their careers. I worked my way up from a call center agent to supervisor, manager,\nsite director, vice president, senior vice president \u2014 and now as the President of Alorica\u2019s North America and Europe regions, I truly feel blessed to be able to reach so many people through the work that we do, whether it\u2019s colleagues, employees, clients\nor their customers.\nCan you share the most interesting or funny story that happened to you since you started this career and what lesson you learned from that? \u00a0 In the early days of my career, I was on rotation as a recruiter, where I\u2019d spend a lot\nof time looking at tons of resumes. One time, there was a resume that stood out to me \u2014 a name that seemed so familiar, but I couldn\u2019t quite place it. As soon as I walked out to call on this next applicant sitting in the lobby, waiting for her interview,\nI screamed in surprise and happiness. The applicant looked up in shock. So did the man she came with, who was also interviewing for a job. They were both from my hometown in Pittsburgh \u2014 people I\u2019ve grown up with! And randomly, here we all were in Texas\nyears later, meeting again through a job interview \u2014 the woman was someone I went to high school with and the man (who turned out to be her husband!) was someone I\u2019ve known since kindergarten. Obviously, these were the days before social media, so I had\nlost touch with them since moving away. This instance showed me how small the world really is and how connected we all are. The interactions we have with others create moments, memories, and opportunities to make a lifelong impact and that\u2019s why I strive\nevery day to do the right thing by my friends, family, and every person I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with.\nAre you working on any exciting new projects at your company? How is this helping people? \u00a0 Being in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic, I would say what I\u2019m on working on \u2014 and have been the past few months \u2014 is nothing like\nI\u2019ve ever done before in the last 30 years of my career. Together, with the partnership of our clients, our teams have been quickly transitioning thousands of employees to work from home across the U.S. and around the world \u2014 all at the same time \u2014 so\nthat they\u2019re able to be safe while continuing to earn a paycheck. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve also been implementing safety measures at all our locations to take care of our onsite employees during COVID-19. This is all while ensuring that we\u2019re able to support\ncustomers during these tough times, especially in essential services like healthcare, banking, utilities, logistics, etc. This has been a massive undertaking that involved many people, sleepless nights, complex planning, backup plans to our backup plans,\nand more. Meanwhile, it\u2019s also been an experience I\u2019d describe as historic, exhilarating, inspiring, and well worth it. I\u2019m proud to say we\u2019ve moved nearly 85 percent of our workforce to work from home within a few short months. I\u2019m definitely going to\nlook back at this time years from now and say, \u201cI was a part of something important\u2026something that forever changed our industry.\u201d\nWonderful. Now let\u2019s jump into the main focus of our series. Hiring can be very time consuming and difficult. Can you share 5 techniques that you use to identify the talent that would be best suited for the job you want to fill?\nHiring the wrong person for the job can be costly and time-consuming, especially considering the volume of positions available in the customer service industry. We\u2019ve implemented tactics at Alorica to ensure we\u2019re hiring the right person for the right\njob. Some examples include:\nWe have an internal tool that matches new customer service agents with the best line of work suited for their personality based on their responses to a behavioral survey.We utilize a system that identifies specific areas new employees can improve on so we can customize the way we coach each of them, ultimately increasing the likelihood they\u2019ll stay with us.Recruiting and promoting from within the organization has been extremely effective for us at Alorica. So instead of looking externally to hire talent, we first start with the people we have, and we invest in their potential. Over 70 percent of our\norganization has been promoted from within, including me!Our Performance Management program is a standardized process for coaching and checking in with our teams every 6 months to identify challenges and strengths and then develop or adjust action plans accordingly. We do this for every level, starting\nwith our Alorica Academy, which includes an agent track learning program and goes all the way up to management.And lastly, change it up! Take risks and try new ways to hire. You never know who you\u2019ll find and how much of a \u201chappy disruptor\u201d it could end up being.\nWith so much noise and competition out there, what are your top 3 ways to attract and engage the best talent in an industry when they haven\u2019t already reached out to you?\nCompany Culture \u2014 have an insanely great one. Treat people with respect, coach, and develop your teams, give them the recognition they deserve and let them have fun in their jobs. Happy employees make for happy customers and that\u2019s\na big deal when you\u2019re in the customer service industry!Referrals \u2014 we have a saying at Alorica: \u201ceveryone is a recruiter.\u201d And it\u2019s so true! Your employees are the best people to promote the company to potential employees, so treat them right. Do the right thing by them and they\u2019ll\ndo the right thing for the company.Communication \u2014 build a foundation of trust at every level by being transparent, sincere, and proactive in your communications with your employees, vendors, clients, community members, social media followers, and every interested\nstakeholder. If you can do this, every one of those people will be a champion of your company and will help share your brand organically, ultimately attracting more talent.\nWhat are the 3 most effective strategies you use to retain employees? \u00a0 Our method for retaining our employees is similar to how we attract them:\nWe are focused on communicating in the most engaging, relevant, sincere, and fun way possible!We are committed to mentoring and coaching our employees so we can promote from within and they can clearly see their career path along the way.We\u2019ve built a culture based on what our employees truly care about, not what we think they should \u2014 we empower them to come up with ideas and we make it a point to recognize their talents and successes.In your experience, is it important for HR to keep up with the latest trends? \u00a0 Absolutely! By staying on top of trends, you\u2019re better able to relate to your target audience and engage them in the way they want to be connected. We\u2019re\nfollowing what\u2019s on social media and in the news and use these recourses to help form how we communicate with our employees and develop the types of contests and other cultural activities they want to participate in, so that in return we can motivate,\ncoach and empower them to do their best. This is especially important when you have a diverse workforce like ours, with employees of different ages and life stages, spread across the globe.\nWhat are some creative ways to increase the value provided to employees without breaking the bank? \u00a0 I\u2019ve learned that the best way to provide something that employees really value is by simply asking them. Once employees realize\nyou want their opinion, they get very creative and resourceful bringing their ideas to life. I\u2019m lucky to work with some of the most amazingly creative people who focus on this at an organizational-level all the way to the site-level. \u00a0 We offer\na variety of opportunities for employees to engage, learn, and get involved with the activities that they\u2019re most interested in. Some of these include: our Women\u2019s Initiative, which is our advocacy/mentorship group to empower future female leaders; Making\nLives Better with Alorica (MLBA) is our nonprofit partner that empowers Alorica employees to decide how and which organizations they give to within their own communities through grassroots fundraising, volunteering, etc.; each of our sites also has a\nCulture Committee, whose members plan onsite events, help oversee companywide celebrations and contests and share company news. Led by a Culture Champion, these individuals act as brand ambassadors with the goal to engage employees to help maintain a\nfantastic working environment for the entire team. Each month, Culture Committees also participate in (and all employees are invited to) an Alorica Connection Call where news, ideas, and celebrations are shared across the organization. Yes, we have a\nmeeting just for \u201ccompany culture\u201d and it WORKS. And you have no idea how much our employees love games, competitions, dress-up days and food!\nWhat are some ways that you\u2019ve been able to cultivate a culture among your employees while working remotely? \u00a0 We have employees at Alorica who have been coming into our brick-and-mortar centers to work for over 20 years. Our goal\nhas been to make sure they, and the rest of our teammates, continue to feel just as engaged while working from home. To do this, we\u2019ve reinforced some of the cultural initiatives that we\u2019ve already been doing, like our contests, weekly recognition, and\nculture calls. We\u2019ve always had a work-at-home team prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and so we were able to draw on our experiences with this business model to decide how to best connect people working in a virtual environment. We\u2019ve implemented video\ntown halls and team huddles to encourage teammates to stay connected to one another and on top of the latest news. We have also surprised employees with lunch at their homes and rolled out a snack box delivery program as a way to say thank you to employees\nfor their continued performance.\nHow are you keeping your employees engaged virtually? \u00a0 Our internal communication tactics are more important than ever as we aim to keep all our teammates feeling connected. We\u2019re communicating more frequently and through different\ntools to maintain their sense of belonging and purpose at our company. By leveraging technology into how we communicate and operate, we\u2019re able to create face-to-face camaraderie in a virtual world, proving that working remotely doesn\u2019t have to be isolating.\nThrough video, chat, and team boards, we\u2019re able to replicate in-person experiences. Employees can continue their one-on-one meetings with their immediate supervisors, converse with teammates, and set goals \u2014 all the things they would normally do in-person.\nIf you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? \u00a0 From my experience as a woman working in a diverse global business as well as a wife and mother (6 beautiful\nkids!) of a racially mixed family, I would say that furthering diversity and inclusion should be a top priority for us all, especially right now. Does it impact the business? The company culture? The people? Yes! AND it\u2019s the right thing to do. As leaders\nin our companies, with influence over many individuals, we\u2019re in a unique position where we can spark real change \u2014 and we must do this. Education around intolerance, violence, discrimination, etc. should not be a \u201ccheck-the-box\u201d exercise, but a crucial\naspect of a company\u2019s culture. People should be given the opportunity to speak and be heard in a peaceful, respectful manner. This movement would be a forum for diverse people to share their points of view, learn from each other, ask questions, solve\nproblems and tear down the walls that make us fearful, judgmental, prejudiced, and unkind.\nCan you please give us your favorite \u201cLife Lesson Quote\u201d and how that was relevant to you in your life? \u00a0 \u201cGet over it.\u201d \u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m at home with my family or at work coaching my team, that\u2019s my motto. Things\nhappen all the time \u2014 sometimes it\u2019s our fault, and sometimes things just happen \u2014 and once it\u2019s done, it\u2019s done. Harboring negative feelings never resulted in anything positive and it paralyzes us from moving on. Yes, it\u2019s okay to have a mourning period\nwhen things don\u2019t work out, but you need to be able to learn from the experience, get back up, and grow from it. Once you do that, you\u2019re mentally prepared for anything\u2026even if that means making more mistakes, which at least teaches us the lesson of what\nnot to do!\nWe are very blessed to have some of the biggest names in Business, VC funding, Sports, and Entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world whom you would love to have a private lunch with, and why? \u00a0 Mary Barra, CEO\nof General Motors. Why? Because she\u2019s a true boss lady in a predominantly male-led industry. And it\u2019s not just because she\u2019s a female leader that I\u2019d want to meet with her, although that makes her even more relatable and interesting to me! I\u2019d love the\nopportunity to sit down and exchange ideas \u2014 get her advice on leadership tactics, operational rigor, and innovation. What do those things mean to her? Ask her opinion on what works, what doesn\u2019t, how to survive, how to really measure success, how to\nkeep learning, when to know to keep going with an idea, but also know when to stop or change directions. I think it would be a great lunch\u2026hopefully with a glass of wine!\nThank you so much for these fantastic insights! \u00a0 This article originally appeared in Authority Magazine: https://bit.ly/3gVkiqn"}

Smaller \"mom-and-pop\" type stores have already shut, unable to maintain their profits with such low\nmargins. \u00a0 E-commerce has emerged as a savior to many of these small and medium enterprises. This adoption provides a unique window for professionals in both communications and marketing to pivot. To adapt to this new reality, marketing professionals have to change\nhow they think. To this end, 13 experts from\u00a0Forbes Communications Council\u00a0examine how professionals can make the best of the changing marketing landscape and adapt to the \"new normal.\"\n1. Tweak Strategies To Reach Remote AudiencesFrom online education (think public and private schools and digital knowledge-based courses) to healthcare (think Zoom appointments with your doctor), communications/marketing professionals will\nneed to tweak their strategies for reaching these audiences. We will need to become savvy online marketers in order to serve consumers where they are, understand their new needs, and message accordingly. -\u00a0Marisa Salcines2. Start By Tracking Your Audience's Activities With e-commerce businesses on the rise, you can actually track your audience's activities on your store \u2014 something you can't do with brick-and-mortar retail \u2014 and analyze that data\nto make your brand aligned with audience needs. Moreover, you can introduce an A-Z model of strategies to optimize how you run your store, from targeting, to sales, to building a community around your brand objectives. -\u00a0Haseeb Tariq,\nUniversal Music Group (ex Disney, Fox and Guess)3. Continue Focusing On Omnichannel Experiences The global pandemic has caused businesses to pivot their business to operate online. While digital is more prominent, the focus on omnichannel experiences doesn't change. People still shop online\nand pick up at a store, for example, so leaders must measure the entire customer experience and apply best practices in a holistic way to keep customers happy and brand-loyal. -\u00a0Stacy Sherman,\nCustomer Experience Expert4. Aim To Provide Optionality And FlexibilityBrick and mortar and e-commerce are no longer mutually exclusive; it's all about having a hybrid model. The option to buy online but pick up in store continues to grow YoY. Customers are looking for\noptionality and flexibility via integrated e-commerce, social networking sites, vertically-integrated platforms and more. -\u00a0Colson Hillier, Alorica5. Use Automated, Personalized Digital MarketingDuring this pandemic, we see retail continuing to shift to a digital-first strategy, along with the budget. Marketing professionals can adapt to a new way of building one-on-one relationships with\nconsumers to drive sales using automated, personalized digital marketing \u2014 combining first-party data, contextual data and insight from consumers' purchase paths across all channels. -\u00a0Anna Luo,\nJivox6. Make Your Message Authentic And Impactful It's not a significant change but more of a rapid advancement of what we've known. We are living in the fourth industrial revolution powered by a digital, globally-connected, remote workforce-enabled\neconomy. Marketers need to ensure their message reaches their audience wherever they may be in an authentic and impactful way. Content marketing and storytelling is the best way to do that. -Ahmad Daher,\nEnvijo7. Focus On Education, Not ImpulseFocus on education, not impulse. Brick-and-mortar retail has always had one significant trick up its sleeve \u2014 the longer customers spend in their store, the more likely they are to impulse-buy. With the\nrise of e-commerce, the power has shifted to the consumer, choosing what and when they buy. In this era, it is better to focus on educating customers because it's never been easier for them to close a tab. -Patrick Ward,\nRootstrap8. Always Provide Value In Your EmailsThe rise of e-commerce due to brick-and-mortar retail is going to change marketing in many ways. One way is that there is going to be an influx of emails in consumers' email boxes. Instead of just sharing\na sale ad, make it more beneficial by showcasing entire outfits and highlighting a designer \u2014 something that makes people want to read your email. -\u00a0Heidi Green,\nBrightMove, Inc.9. Create Impulse-Buy Opportunities For Curbside Curbside pickup is exploding, along with e-commerce in general. Marketers need to recreate in the curbside experience the impulse-buy opportunities found in store. Curbside provides a natural, regular\nand needed communication channel between retailer and consumer with every order. Personalized and relevant additional product messaging in order-confirmation and order-ready emails is a big opportunity. -\nIndy Guha,\u00a0Signifyd10. Find Digital Alternatives To Physical ExperiencesThe decline of traditional retail is challenging marketing to come up with digital alternatives for physical product/brand experiences. How will brands enable shoppers to try out products in\nstore, touch fabrics, smell scents, etc? And without these experiences, how does marketing convince first-time shoppers? Credible consumer recommendations, how-to videos and reviews on e-commerce might help. -\nRafael Schwarz,\u00a0TERRITORY Influence (a Bertelsmann group company)11. Plan Your Marketing Investment For ResultsWhile businesses struggle to keep their doors open, we must begin to recognize the power that lies within effective digital marketing. As more businesses shift to a digital-first strategy, plan your\nonline marketing investment for results, not just clicks. -\u00a0Jessica Wong,Valux, LLC12. Collect, Unify, Utilize Consumer DataWith the unprecedented shift to digital during this global pandemic, the amount of data available about customer interactions has exploded. Companies who struggled to manage customer data before, now have\nan even bigger challenge. Marketers will increasingly need to to collect, unify and utilize this data in their messaging and campaigns using customer data platforms or similar technologies. -Tom Treanor,\nTreasure Data13. Leverage The Right TechnologyRemote offices, learning and entertainment have created broad acceptance of video tools that can bring store associates closer to the consumer in their home. In-person shopping is no longer a pastime \u2014 so\nbrick-and-mortar stores need to get closer to their customers than ever using technology to introduce new products, answer questions, and make the sale. -\u00a0Dan Wallace-Brewster,\nScalefast \u00a0The article was originally published on Forbes.com at https://bit.ly/38SRr5m.

Brands can no longer depend on the\nrush of holiday foot traffic to keep sales momentum, and with the explosion of e-commerce creating new methods of shopping, retailers need to rethink how they are reaching their customers during the busiest season of the year.\nTo explore how the pandemic has impacted retailers and shifted consumer buying behaviors this holiday season, I spoke with Paulo Silva, Senior Vice President of Client Solutions at\u00a0Alorica,\na leading global customer experience solutions provider that supports more than 2 billion customer interactions per year. Servicing several of the world\u2019s largest retailers and many other Fortune 500 companies, Alorica offers a suite of world-class customer experience services and technology, including customer relationship management tools and back office support.\nLeveraging Silva\u2019s 28 years of experience in enhancing the customer experience (CX) and brand loyalty including 15+ years as a client and provider within the retail space, we analyzed new data from\nProsper Insights & Analytics Monthly Consumer Survey. The survey saw\nresponses from over 7,000 US consumers on a broad selection of spending intentions and retail behaviors with additional predictions and insights on Covid-19\u2019s impact on holiday shopping habits.\nGary Drenik: How has the pandemic impacted the retail industry as we head into the 2020 holiday season?\nPaulo Silva:\u00a0Holiday shopping has already drastically changed for retailers in comparison to previous years. Based on Prosper Insights & Analytics\u2019 Monthly Consumer Survey, the vast majority admitted they could be convinced\nto purchase gifts earlier than they typically do, attributing this to several factors including avoiding crowds, mitigating the stress of last-minute shopping, and incentives like seasonal deals.\u00a0The survey found that consumers are beginning\ntheir holiday shopping earlier than ever before, with 42% stating that they planned to start their holiday shopping by the end of October, and as of early November, over half of holiday shoppers have already started making purchases. As a result,\nthe typical timeline for retailers to prepare for the influx of holiday sales has pivoted, with holiday inventory and promotions kicking off even earlier than usual. This accelerated timeline has made retailers allocate more resources to prepare for\nthe holiday rush earlier and extend the season longer.\nBecause it will be less about camping out and waiting in long lines to get through the mad rush inside stores on Black Friday and during the holidays, consumers will also expect better CX. They\u2019re no longer at the mercy of these major in-store deals\non specific days, so retailers need to work harder for customer loyalty. To ensure loyalty and affinity toward a retail brand\u2014while differentiating themselves from the competition\u2014better customer service is necessary. Consumers need personalized\nexperiences now more than ever before, and brands that can successfully implement customization and optionality within their CX strategies will come out on top. It's essential for retailers to\nincorporate a human element into their CX approach\u00a0as well. This includes incorporating empathy and tailored recommendations that consumers would typically experience in-store into every touchpoint across\nthe customer journey.\u00a0One example of this is loyalty programs that make customers feel special and provide the white glove, concierge-type services that they are seeking.\nDrenik: It\u2019s no surprise that retailers are adjusting their operations to create a safe shopping experience during this global health crisis, but how have consumers' shopping habits changed amid Covid-19?\nSilva:\u00a0With holiday sales starting earlier and lasting longer, consumers are becoming more flexible with their holiday shopping plans than in previous years. The pandemic has given customers more time to really think\nthrough their holiday shopping list and evaluate their purchasing options. Prosper\u2019s November data found that on average,\u00a0holiday shoppers have completed\u00a0only\u00a026 percent of their shopping so far. With many consumers still sheltering\nin place and reevaluating their travel plans for the holidays, customers have more time to focus on holiday shopping, in turn making the retail landscape much more competitive than previous years.\nAccording to Prosper Insights & Analytics\u2019 Monthly Consumer Survey, thousands of people plan on spending more or about the same on gifts for their families, friends, coworkers, etc. this season, which shows holiday shopping is still top of mind\nfor many customers despite the down-turning economy. Feedback from the survey also found that spending on holiday decorations (tree, lights, candles, decor) is expected to increase from $87.96 last year to $90.75 this year, with spending on greeting\ncards and postage projected to follow suit with a $2.93 increase for 2020. This data comes as no surprise, knowing that many people have been quarantining for most of the year. With less individuals partaking in usual festivities or traveling to see\nfamily, many are focused on creating the holiday experience at home and staying connected with loved ones from afar. With this change in consumer holiday experiences, brands and CX providers need to pivot their focus to a more targeted approach that\ncaters to this shift in mindset and purchasing habits in order to allocate resources accordingly.\nRetailers should have already implemented their holiday CX strategies as it\u2019s clear that many consumers are not waiting until Black Friday to start their shopping.\u00a0When customers connect with a brand, companies need to be \u2018fully locked\nin\u2019 to that transaction too, especially across various channels, thus making up-selling more important. This creates a degree of urgency around first call resolution and quality assurance, where it becomes critical that brands can resolve customer\nissues and complaints the first time around.\nDrenik: Prosper Insights & Analytics found that as a response to the global health crisis, 55.4% of adults are shopping in stores less. Where and how do you think consumers will be making most of their holiday purchases this year?\nSilva:\u00a0With more attention on e-commerce this year than ever before, it's no surprise that online purchases have grown exponentially. Prosper Insights & Analytics did find that consumers are still considering\nbrick-and-mortar stores as a top holiday destination, with a large majority (70%) of customers stating that they have felt safe shopping in stores this holiday season, given the precautions retailers have taken for Covid-19. Unlike previous years,\ncustomers want all the options when it comes to their shopping experience, with the evolution of buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS) and curbside, consumers have more shopping options than ever before. The survey data also found that nearly all (91%)\nonline shoppers plan to take advantage of free shipping this holiday season, while another 44% plan to use BOPIS and 16% plan to use same-day delivery.\u00a0It\u2019s all about the hybrid shopping experience; people don\u2019t just want it both\nways\u2014online or in store\u2014they want ALL THE WAYS. With all these options of how and where to buy, retailers really need to make their experience count and go the extra mile with their customer service.\nDrenik: That\u2019s very interesting... do you anticipate this hybrid shopping experience will create any changes to customer expectations this holiday season?\nSilva:\u00a0While catering to varying needs is important, with all these options to purchase and deliver comes the complicated task for retailers to make sure their customer journey is receiving five stars on all channels.\nRetailers need to remember that CX is holiday agnostic. Buyers don\u2019t care that brands are dealing with an influx of demands. They still expect a personalized, frictionless experience coordinated across all channels, also known as omnichannel\norchestration. Consumers want a seamless experience whether browsing online from the safety of your home, utilizing BOPIS, or even having someone come bring it out to your car curbside\u2014all of this should be communicated to the customers quickly,\neasily and in lock step.\nAdditionally, find ways to make the consumer feel valued. With more channels and options to purchase this holiday season, it can be easy for retailers to fall back into the \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach, which is harmful for customer retention.\nSo beyond adding a human touch to your CX strategy, how do you cater to your VIP loyalty customers?\u00a0Now that \u201ceveryone\u201d gets more options, what do VIP or extra loyal customers get? Do you offer them first, quicker or better access\nto new items or deals? Do they receive priority curbside or delivery? In order to maintain this rapport, it's important for retailers to focus on all their loyal customers and yet also differentiate among the \u2018super loyal\u2019 and determine\nwhat rewards will be given to each tier of repeat purchasers.\nDrenik: Overall, what\u2019s your advice to brands on how to ensure a positive customer experience and loyalty this holiday season?\nSilva:\u00a0My best advice to brands looking to strengthen their CX strategy this holiday season would be to deliver optionality and make it as convenient as possible. It's vital that retailers be comprehensive and cohesive\nthroughout the customer journey. With Covid-19 forcing us to reimagine the traditional holiday shopping experience, safety, peace of mind, coordination and extra customer service are going to matter now, more than ever before. The retailers that will\nwin this season are implementing these things in every aspect of their 2020 holiday CX program in order to create a positive experience and loyalty among their consumers.\nDrenik: There used to be an old loyalty meme that went something like this: \u201cIf you are in retail and expect loyalty, buy a dog.\u201d\u00a0Today new CX platforms like Alorica are providing a way for retailers to enhance customer experience and increase loyalty.\u00a0My thanks to Paulo Silva for sharing his insights and solution for this important topic.\nThe article was originally published on Forbes.com at https://bit.ly/3pLP0Hu.

{"_id": "doc_114", "title": "Empathy: A New Kind Of Leadership", "text": "https://alorica.com/news/detail/empathy-a-new-kind-of-leadership\nHome\nIn The News\nEmpathy: A New Kind Of Leadership\nEmpathy: A New Kind Of Leadership\nPublished on December 2, 2020\nShare this\nAlorica's\u00a0CMO, bringing large-scale transformation to brands and creating a personalized CX via digital/traditional channels for 20+ years. \u00a0 The year 2020\nhas been filled with unexpected firsts and life-altering changes for many. Not only have we seen a massive economic shift within our communities, but also a social revolution \u2014 all amid one of the most attention-grabbing elections of our time.\nWhile news headlines and social media posts may be difficult to digest these days, we\u2019ve never been more digitally connected with our customers, employees and communities. With access to all this information, now is the right time for us to lean\ninto our emotional intelligence and express empathy in everything that we do \u2014 not just for personal development, but also for business growth. \u00a0 With the challenges this year has presented, many employers have come to learn that soft skills\ncan make or break employee morale and even a deal. As marketing communications professionals, we know the golden rule is to know our audience. Understanding the sentiment and emotional health of our audiences will not only expand our views on a personal\nlevel, but it also provides a competitive advantage both internally and externally. \u00a0 Here are four ways cultivating a more empathetic work environment can benefit your business in the long term:\nIncrease Employee Engagement No one was prepared for navigating a pandemic compounded with civil unrest. This perfect storm has served as a catalyst for change in workplace culture. The events of 2020 humanized every level of an organization\nas we encountered challenges together. With this has come a newfound need for compassion at work. \u00a0 Recognizing signs your employees display when things may not be going well is important. When our teams believe we are seeking to understand their\npersonal and professional hardships, we\u2019re able to foster a new level of mutual trust and respect, which can ultimately yield more committed, focused and happy team members. \u00a0 Encourage an open-door policy, and have managers check in with their\nemployees regularly. Start meetings and conversations with team members by asking how they\u2019re doing. Many successful businesses also harness the power of technology to monitor the sentiment of teams through companywide mentorship programs, surveys\nand other communications tools. Analyze this data, and then follow through with engagement, demonstrating that you value their feedback and that you\u2019re committed to supporting their development.\nElevate The Customer Experience When you champion a welcoming environment with acceptance for differing perspectives, backgrounds and cultures, your associates are able to be inherently more empathetic and pay it forward when interacting\nwith customers. In fact, a 2019 survey on workplace culture found that\u00a074%\u00a0of employees agree that workplace culture directly impacts their ability to best serve customers. \u00a0 Implementing diversity, equity and inclusion programs is one way to ensure\nyour staff has a well-rounded perspective and can adequately connect to a variety of consumers with kindness, fairness and patience, leading to a better customer experience (CX).\nFor those on the front lines of customer service, prompt them to take close inventory of the tone and expressions customers exhibit. These subtle cues can be picked up on when navigating difficult interactions and will help your service representatives\npivot the conversation when needed.\nStimulate Creativity Studies have shown there is a\u00a0direct correlation\u00a0between\nempathy and creativity. Why? Again, it\u2019s all about perspective. Empathetic teams have the ability to understand and internalize the frame of reference of others, which can broaden outlooks and break barriers in the workplace. This emotional intelligence\nallows you to think and see things differently. It can lead to increased collaboration, innovation, the ability to identify solutions, a mutual understanding among peers and overall amplified productivity. \u00a0 Consider incorporating empathy training\nfor managers to foster productive dialogue with team members so that everyone feels respected and encouraged to voice their thoughts. This can spark creative collaboration among people who may not typically connect otherwise.\nGet Ahead Of Customer Needs Every consumer group has a distinct set of simple human truths they can all identify with \u2014 they want to be respected, treated fairly, heard and understood. When employees tap into that mindset, they\nare better able to anticipate and address customer needs before they even arise. \u00a0 Implore your teams to reframe their way of thinking through a lens of empathy, which can allow them to anticipate customer pain points and, in turn, help them deliver\nmore impactful CX solutions upfront. Consider applying empathy to your customer journey process in order to achieve deeper engagement with your customer segments. \u00a0 Demonstrating a commitment to compassion within our leadership strategies will move\nus forward in new and exciting ways. As we all look to a new year with endless possibilities \u2014 and some uncertainties \u2014 empathy is part of the foundation for building strong teams and a culture that enables organizations to adapt, service\nand sell, no matter what 2021 may bring. \u00a0 The article was originally published on Forbes.com at https://bit.ly/3ocmkWG"}
{"_id": "doc_115", "title": "5 Ways Chatbots Improve Employee Experience", "text": "https://alorica.com/news/detail/5-ways-chatbots-improve-employee-experience\nHome\nIn The News\n5 Ways Chatbots Improve Employee Experience\n5 Ways Chatbots Improve Employee Experience\nPublished on November 22, 2020\nShare this\nMany companies use AI chatbots on their websites to give customers a way to instantly access information about products and services. More businesses are discovering that chatbots can be used to improve the employee experience, too. \u00a0 Oracle and Future Workplace\u2019s annual\u00a0AI at Work report\u00a0revealed that\n64% of employees would trust an AI chatbot more than their manager and half of them have used an AI chatbot rather than go to their manager for advice. When asked what AI bots can do better than their managers, 26% of respondents said bots are better\nat providing unbiased information and 34% said they were better at maintaining work schedules. Other answers included problem-solving (29%) and managing a budget (26%). \u00a0 The majority of employees (65%) said that they are optimistic, excited and grateful about having AI bot \u201cco-workers\u201d and nearly 25% said that they have a gratifying relationship with AI it their workplace. Here are several ways chatbots can\nbe used to increase employee satisfaction, productivity, engagement, loyalty and retention.\nChatbots Enhance Employee Self Service and Human ResourcesAI chatbots are being used to accomplish many of the complex processes, policies and frameworks that are part of the human resources (HR) department\u2019s daily tasks. An AI chatbot is available for employees 24 hours a day, and allows HR, through the\nchatbot, to answer common employee questions relating to employee benefits, scheduling, insurance, vacation and sick time. AI can also provide fast, personalized replies to their queries. This saves HR time and effort while providing the employee\nwith a positive, satisfying experience. \u00a0 Elizabeth Ebert, North America Advisory IT Lead at\u00a0Avanade\u00a0said that human resources professionals are using\nAI chatbots in many different ways to engage employees, especially with the recent focus on the remote workplace. \u201cAs new ways of working emerge, employees are more frequently in virtual locations using a variety of collaboration platforms that\ncan be leveraged for chatbot technology,\u201d she said. \u201cChatbots provide 24/7 access for employees and can span most of the collaboration methods that organizations are using to build their virtual organization.\u201d \u00a0 Mirroring the results of the Oracle and Future Workplace report, Ebert said employees have found AI chatbots to be effective at providing answers to their questions and enhancing employee engagement. \u201cAs AI supporting chatbots have become more effective\nin creating more conversational engagement, which drives great satisfaction in those interactions, chatbots also provide more consistent responses to HR inquiries,\u201d she said.\nPersonalizing and Streamlining the Recruiting ProcessIt's not just the nuts and bolts of HR where chatbots are having an effect. Many companies are embracing AI to improve the recruitment process. The aim is to enhance the candidate experience of the potential employee while allowing HR professionals to\nfocus on more pressing issues. \u00a0 Irvine, Calif.-based\u00a0Alorica Inc.\u00a0is one example of a company that uses recruiting chatbots to find talent. Potential employees apply at their convenience while the chatbot conducts\nthe initial candidate screening process. The result is that Alorica, a customer management company that provides call center services and support, saves time and reduces hiring costs, decreases manual outreach to candidates, and saves in-person follow-ups\nfor pre-qualified applicants, thereby increasing the productivity of hiring teams. \u00a0 Another benefit of AI-driven chatbots is that when they have been trained using an appropriate dataset, they can help reach a more diverse group of candidates. Human bias remains a significant barrier for many hiring teams. While AI doesn't eliminate\nbias, it can be useful to bring in a broader set of candidates. \u00a0 Brad Snedeker, product marketing director at\nCalabrio, a customer experience software company, said the move to the remote workplace has removed the barriers of\nhiring geographically diverse employees but has increased the level of competition for top talent. \"As a first touchpoint, companies need to smooth the application process for agents,\" he said. \"Bots can assist during applications to offer a better\nself-service experience to applicants and ease the process by helping manage some of the steps for them.\"\nStreamlining New Employee OnboardingChatbots can be used to notify applicants about interview procedures, significant dates, the completion of documentation, information about the position itself, and once they're hired, help new employees get acquainted with the brand, its culture, rules\nand basic information. \u00a0 Along with easing the new employee into the company, chatbots can also gather required information from the new employee and walk them through the onboarding process as they fill out the required forms and learn what is expected of them in the critical\nfirst few days. Onboarding chatbots are also able to take the new employee through a post-onboarding survey or provide instant access to mundane questions such as software, services, network and Intranet access, and other details about the company,\nall without the interaction of an HR professional. \u00a0 \"A new employee who has simple onboarding questions can consult with the bot and get their answers quickly, all without having to loop in the HR team,\" said\u00a0Devin Pickell, growth marketer at\u00a0Nextiva.\u00a0\"These bots can also integrate with internal communication tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams, which adds to the convenience of using these bots.\"\nChatbots for Learning and Skill DevelopmentA\nreport from TalentLMS\u00a0revealed that since the COVID-19\ncrisis began, 42% of companies have increased their reskilling and upskilling efforts and 74% of employees that did not have the opportunity for additional skill training said they would prefer to work for a company that offered it. Ongoing learning\ninitiatives are more important than other perks and benefits to millennials and Gen Z, the fastest growing segments of the workforce. A\u00a02020 survey from getAbstract\u00a0indicated that over 50% of members of those two groups believe a successful career depends on frequently updating their skills and\nknowledge. \u00a0 AI chatbots offer companies an opportunity to provide employees with personalized learning and skill development content. By integrating chatbots that use natural language processing and machine learning abilities with existing learning platforms, employees\ncan be guided through the training initiative without requiring the intervention of HR staff. \u00a0 With so many employees working remotely, companies often have a difficult time knowing which workers are struggling and this is where AI chatbots can make a difference. This is useful for employees that interact with customers in real time, like call\ncenter agents. \"Connecting bots with the stream of insights coming from interaction analytics and quality evaluations can be a mainline to see exactly which agents need what kind of training and when,\" Snedeker said. \"The virtual assistant can then\nat the right-time, based on staffing levels and customer demand, offer agents opportunities to take time for an e-learning break for a dedicated topic or offer up future training slots that can be added to their schedule.\"\nMaking Customer Service More ResponsiveChatbots can also enhance customer service by putting data and tools in the hands of employees when they can make the biggest difference. Most chatbots are able to answer typical questions customers ask and tap into a customer\u2019s prior purchasing\nhistory in order to provide personalized customer service. \u00a0 \"It's hard to land on a SaaS website today without seeing a chatbot pop up and greet you,\" said Nextiva's Pickell. \"Chatbots play an increasingly important role in customer service, support and sales.\" He said\u00a095% of customer interactions\u00a0are expected to take place via an AI chatbot or live chat by 2025. \u00a0 The article was originally published on CMSwire.

These have been brought into sharp relief during the COVID-19 pandemic, as has the country\u2019s long-held position as a resilient value\nplay. \u00a0 \u201cWe don\u2019t look at Uruguay as a cost play \u2013 this is a value and capability play,\u201d says Chris Crowley,\u00a0EVP\u00a0and Chief Commercial Officer at Alorica. \u201cOur services from Uruguay are not part of a commoditized BPO offering, and instead rely on\nan educated workforce that can deliver more complex and sophisticated services in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.\u201d \u00a0 Alorica has been in Uruguay since 2016 when it acquired Expert Global Solutions (EGS),the world\u2019s largest privately-owned BPO company at the time. Today, Alorica has about 850 full-time employees in the Aguada\u00a0Park free trade zone in downtown Montevideo, Uruguay\u2019s capital, one of 12 free trade zones in the country\nMontevideo\u202fis a city well in excess of one million people \u2013 we get the benefit of a big city\nwithout the drawbacks,\u201d says Crowley. \u201cWe can grow as fast as we need to because the talent is there thanks to the country\u2019s strong educational policies, such as giving a laptop to every child when they start school.\u201d \u00a0 Alorica moved fast during\nthe pandemic to allow its employees to work from home, helped by Montevideo\u2019s robust infrastructure. As in other countries of Latin America and the Caribbean,\u00a0Uruguay has also temporarily waived tax concerns related to having employees working outside\nof the tax-free zone.\nPunching Above Its Weight \u00a0 Uruguay is a small country tucked between two Latin American giants,\u00a0Brazil\u00a0and Argentina. Historically, it has used this position to its advantage, benefitting from trade with its large neighbors and\nensuring that it can deliver political and economic stability to a population of only 3.5 million. \u00a0 \u201cUruguay\u2019s location bordering the largest and third-largest economies in Latin America \u2013 Brazil and Argentina \u2013 as well as its efforts to encourage\ninvestment and convert itself into a logistical hub for the region, mean that in many regards it offers opportunities that outsize its modest geography,\u201d says Craig Dempsey, Managing Director and Co-Founder of Biz Latin Hub Group, which provides back-office\nservices to companies looking to invest or locate in Latin America. \u00a0 \u201cWhile an inflation rate hovering between 5% and 10% over the past fifteen years is relatively high, Uruguay has remained stable while other countries from the region have seen\nmuch greater fluctuations and volatility,\u201d he adds. \u00a0 In fact, the political and economic statistics for Uruguay often put it at the top of the ladder when compared to other countries in Latin America. \u00a0 For example, in Transparency International\u2019s\n2019 edition of its Corruption Perceptions Index, Uruguay had the lowest levels of perceived corruption in Latin America and the Caribbean. In 2018, the Intelligence Unit of the Economist placed Uruguay in first spot in Latin America for Political and\nSocial Stability. The World Bank consistently gives Uruguay top marks in the region for Political Stability, Government Effectiveness, and Regulatory Quality \u2013 among other categories. \u00a0 \u201cUruguay\u2019s strong democracy and political, social and economic\nstability enable a safe and stable environment for doing business,\u201d says Natacha\u00a0Emicuri, Uruguay\u2019s\nDeputy Country Head for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). \u201cThe country has also emerged as a leader in executing our new TCS Secure Borderless\u00a0WorkSpaces\u00a0(SBWSTM) model, thanks to the country\u2019s reliable and highly functional IT infrastructure.\u201d\nBack in 2002, Uruguay was TCS\u2019s first Global Delivery Center to in Latin America. The country was chosen due to its unique advantages, including ease of doing. Over time, from TCS\u2019s perspective, its value proposition has only grown. \u00a0 \u201cOver the last\n20 years or so, Uruguay has made significant investments in business-enabling areas to help diversify its economy,\u201d says\u00a0Emicuri. \u201cThis has led to several progressive changes\u00a0in the country\u2019s IT connectivity, creating and amplifying technology educational\nprograms and promoting the incubation of IT and technology investments with key benefits.\u201d \u00a0 At present, TCS Uruguay is the largest technology company in Uruguay. It operates from three buildings in the\u202fZonamerica\u00a0free trade zone in Montevideo, with nearly 2000 consultants. \u00a0 Like every country in the world, Uruguay has had to weather some economic headwinds during the\npandemic. According to Fitch Solutions, employment and import demand remain suppressed, resulting in\u202fa widening of Uruguay\u2019s current account balance in 2021. Inflation was in excess of 10% during periods of 2020 and the Uruguayan peso depreciated as COVID-19 ran rampant throughout\nSouth\u00a0America, and\u00a0hit the elephant next door \u2013 Brazil \u2013 particularly hard. \u00a0 \u201cUruguay will always be subject to the ebbs and flows of its neighbors\u2019 fortunes,\u201d says Dempsey from Biz Latin Hub Group. \u201cHowever, the country has also benefited from\nits ability to implement and oversee sounder financial policies than its neighbors.\u201d \u00a0 Assuming that a society is otherwise stable \u2013 which has been true of Uruguay \u2013 a boost in inflation and a depreciating currency can often be turned to the advantage\nof BPO providers given that they sell their services in dollars. \u00a0 \u201cThe devaluation of the currency in 2020 was dramatic,\u201d says Jose G. Ramirez, Alorica\u2019s VP of Operations and Chief of Staff for LATAM and The Caribbean. \u201cIt helped us move some targets\nin terms of margins.\u201d Alorica\u2019s employees in Montevideo are protected somewhat in that they make well above minimum wage, though over time inflation could be a concern.\u202f The government is making some policy decisions, such as suspending federal wage increases,\u00a0in\nan effort to\u00a0keep things under control. And though things look bleak now,\u202fFocus Economics expects a rebound in 2021\u00a0 But there is another shift happening that is beyond anyone\u2019s control that bodes well for BPO \u2013 and outsourcing in general \u2013 in Uruguay. That is the fact that more and more companies are looking to develop digital capabilities, leveraging cloud,\nautomation, AI, and Agile technologies and practices. \u00a0 \u201cTCS Uruguay has experienced and been a part of these transformational initiatives,\u201d says\u00a0Emicuri. \u201cWe have experienced several instances of clients looking for Uruguay to become a more prominent\ndelivery location within their global IT landscape, frequently taking the front seat in implementation work, providing key leadership and integration roles and improving the balance between delivery sites.\u201d \u00a0 Written by Tim Wilson this article originally\nappeared in Nearshore Americas:\u202fhttp://bit.ly/2MkjP7v"}

So how you manage your company's online reputation matters. It's about promoting and protecting your brand so it\ncan be discovered, followed, recommended and even defended in a predominantly digital marketplace. And it's not as easy as simply running your own website or social media pages. You have to influence and fact check what everyone else says about your\ncompany. Doing online reputation management right is something companies should prioritize.\nDigital marketing is not just trendy; it's essential. \u00a0 Let's start with the facts. According to Pew Research, about 70% of Americans use social media. Let's\nnot forget that social media is deeply embedded in the customer journey, especially for discovery and research. But social media isn't limited to just Facebook or Instagram \u2014 according to Datareportal typical social media users are members of more than eight different platforms. \u00a0 Throw in the fact that 2020 has been an epically unusual year. With the pandemic, Black Lives Matter and the recent U.S. election, it's no surprise that Datareportal found that as of January 2021, the annual growth in social media users was over 13%.\nThese staggering figures reemphasize what we know is true \u2014 today's consumer experience is influenced and often defined by what\u2019s online.\nManaging your business's online reputation is serious business...and it never ends.\u00a0 \u00a0 Marketers know that advertising online is one of the fastest and most effective ways to reach target audiences. But what about monitoring and ensuring\u00a0all\u00a0digital content about your brand \u2014 including user-generated content \u2014\nis accurate and appropriate? That's why online reputation management is so important. In fact, according to Weber Shandwick data (\nvia PR Newswire), executives believe their\ncompanies' reputation accounts for 63% of their market value on average. \u00a0 Online reputation management includes having accurate business listings and relevant advertisements, staying on top of engagement with consumers on your company's marketplace and social channels, understanding their pain points and responding to reviews\nand surveys. Particularly for large companies, this can mean processing large volumes of data quickly, accurately and economically, including consumer reviews, surveys and social posts across multiple online points of presence, while continually making\nsure your content is professional, transparent, relatable and fresh. \u00a0 Another area to consider is content moderation. At Alorica, we deploy content moderation experts to monitor digital content to protect clients and their customers from online abuse. This includes\nidentifying fraudsters, fake news, illegal content, data privacy violations, harassment, hate speech and more, all of which can damage a company's reputation. It's important to monitor content to ensure the platforms you use to connect with consumers\nare safe and aligned to your brand. As people all around the world continue to talk about brands and their products, companies have a lot at stake reputationally and financially if they fail to make good decisions in both online reputation management\nand content moderation.\nA combination of humans and bots can help protect your business. \u00a0 As passionate consumers take to the internet to share opinions, unfortunately, brand bashing, misleading information and flat-out inaccuracies about your products will get out there. Such content erodes trust and confidence in brands. It can also put\nindividuals and online communities at risk. \u00a0 So, what can you do to counter this digital threat? You can deploy a digitally-enabled human shield that allows you to stay aware and help you control your brand's narrative on the worldwide web. \u00a0 As companies rely more on online communities to deliver customer experiences (CX), ensuring a safe environment for people to interact in is paramount. But when you're regulating a virtual landscape, the importance of the human element cannot be overemphasized.\nWhile you can use AI and automation to make broad sweeps and flag obvious offenses, the subtleties of some content and context can only be detected by a well-trained team. \u00a0 If your business is looking to manage and monitor online content about your brand in house, it's critical that you hire the most fit candidates up front for this type of specialized work. Deploy recruiting assessments and realistic job previews that help\nidentify the right people \u2014 psychologically, culturally and behaviorally. Look for those with high attention to detail, resiliency, stress tolerance and emotional intelligence. Also, make sure to provide ample hands-on practice and simulations\nfor moderating a variety of policies and topics, and change them up frequently. Introduce wellness and coping techniques in resiliency training and encourage group conversations about understanding the importance of a content moderator\u2019s role. \u00a0 Given the complexity of work and changing regulatory requirements, I believe the need for expert content monitoring and moderating is significantly increasing. Meanwhile, with machine learning, AI, statistical analysis and predictive modeling, companies\nare now able to increase and improve their visibility, engagement and CX online. \u00a0 For companies that opt to go with an online reputation management and/or content moderation partner, look for scalability, speed and skill \u2014 and make sure you choose someone who understands your particular market and consumer profile well. Find\na partner that has expertise in hiring and training a highly qualified and specialized workforce. Then deploy the right kind of safety protocols to protect the people doing this work and the content itself.It's important to stay plugged in, protected and popular.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The world is more connected than ever, but our online communities struggle with bad actors who can sully the reputation of well-respected brands with misinformation. Like it or not, social media is\u00a0the\u00a0media, and the internet is\nthe\u00a0marketplace. So, it's our responsibility as brand ambassadors to keep the facts straight and our reputations going strong...because, you know, the internet never sleeps. \u00a0 Written by Colson Hillier, Alorica\u2019s CMO this article originally appeared on Forbes.com:http://bit.ly/3aPerTk"}

What has been a fairly well-established model \u2014 where we could operate call centers on behalf of our clients and manage that customer experience more effectively \u2014 is getting disrupted. And a big part of that is the way that technology is supporting more personalization, new channels for customers to engage with brands, and thinking through how to bring together a value proposition that takes a massive distributed labor force and enables them with technology that then delivers an outcome, utilizing proven processes and techniques.\u201d\u00a0 Those are the words of Colson Hillier,\u00a0the CMO of Alorica and\non this episode of Marketing Trends, he discusses the radical shift in how large scale customer service departments \u2014 such as call centers \u2014 are being forced to alter their format and where Alorica comes into play. Plus, Colson details how\npersonalization efforts continue to put the customer experience at the forefront of every decision.\nMain Takeaways:\nThe Good \u2018Ole Days:The market for customer service outsourcing is changing significantly. The well-established model of operating call centers on behalf of clients has been disrupted due to new personalization methods and how\nconsumers can easily interact and engage with brands at a quicker pace.Bring the Value:\u00a0The overall value proposition that brands are bringing to their clients is no longer rooted in products, but rather the overall experience and how the customer is able to utilize the service.The Big Chair:\u00a0The role of the CMO is no longer about nit-picking products and campaigns, but rather a broader scope of responsibility and not just thinking about the overall product portfolio, but rather product development,\nmarketing, and how the company tells the overall story of the organization.\nKey Quotes:\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been at the forefront of trying to think about what are the products or services that we should be building in order to meet an opportunity or solve a customer pain point. As a CMO, it\u2019s a broader scope of responsibility and thinking about not just our product portfolio and product development and product marketing, but also the way that we operate and tell that story through our organization.\u201d\n\u201cThe market for customer service outsourcing is changing dramatically. What has been a fairly, well-established model where we could operate call centers on behalf of our clients and manage that customer experience more effectively is getting disrupted.

You can take an experience that didn\u2019t go down a green path and make it something that a customer says, \u2018Wow, They understood my issue and they did what was necessary to resolve it.\u2019 You\u2019re looking at a more holistic view of the customer rooted in lifetime value, and there\u2019s more and more of an appreciation for the service and post-purchase experience that a customer has.\u201d\n\u201cOver the past year, we\u2019ve had to completely rethink every way that we service and deliver what is essentially the same value proposition in an entirely different operating model. And that\u2019s Alorica Anywhere. So the idea is that no longer is your workforce a constraint and no longer is our technology constrained.\u201d\n\u201cThe ability to combine technologies like cloud, CRM, and personalization, all of that comes together in order to allow us to execute and deliver that service experience from any place on earth.\u201d\nBio: \u00a0 With more than 20 years of experience leading large-scale transformations in complex industries \u2014 including data services, ad tech, and fintech \u2014 Colson serves as Alorica\u2019s Chief Marketing Officer.

While brands know to stock shelves, hire extra staff and ramp up marketing campaigns, preparing for the holiday rush can still be overwhelming. This year, addressing the already daunting peak season demand is further exacerbated by worldwide supply chain constraints, staffing challenges, heightened customer demands, and prolonged shopper concern over going into stores and being around droves of fellow patrons.\nBut let\u2019s not underestimate the toll a bad customer service experience can have on a business. According to Microsoft, 58% of consumers will switch companies because of poor customer service. To avoid becoming one of them, consider these tips for how CX teams can overcome this holiday season\u2019s many challenges to keep customers happy while setting the stage for sustained success into 2022.\nCountering Supply Chain Disruptions\nIt\u2019s important to remember that CX is holiday agnostic. Customers often ignore that supply constraints on holiday goods are out of retailers\u2019 control and still expect a frictionless shopping experience. To offset low or delayed inventory, brands and retailers must design exceptional customer experiences that offer value in other ways.\nIntegrate white glove, concierge-type service into CX to ensure shoppers feel special and accounted for. This could include enhanced incentives like seasonal deals, extended return/exchange timelines, or curated product lists to replace items that may be unavailable or delayed.\nNavigating Peak Demand in a Hybrid World\nThe retail industry is still determining the best infrastructure for a hybrid shopping world, further complicated by peak demand periods like holiday. Brands and retailers should create seamless and personalized experiences by using customization and optionality in their CX approaches, accommodating shoppers who favor buy now, pay later (BNPL); buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS); and same-day delivery.\nAdditionally, ensure there are enough customer assistance resources both in-store and online, service providers are accepting feedback, and that customers feel valued by providing loyalty benefits and rewards. Optionality and convenience are among the most important ways to strengthen CX this holiday season.\nLeveraging Technology to Fill Service Gaps\nEven when human agents can\u2019t accommodate all customer requests, it is still essential customers feel heard. Technology can help fill in holes and ensure seamless customer care. For example, AI chatbots can provide real-time customer service and help offset long wait times that frustrate customers.\nThe key is to keep more complex inquiries in the hands of human agents who can deliver high-touch and personalized service while automating those interactions that are simpler and occur more frequently. If the customer needs to speak with a representative, it\u2019s probably not the right use case for a bot.\nUtilizing Data to Sustain Momentum Post-Holiday.\nMost importantly, retailers need to prove that they were listening during the holidays. Allow your customers to provide feedback, good and bad, to ensure teams can better service skills when they are needed most.\nUse the insights gathered during the peak season to send personalized offers that speak directly to customers\u2019 interests. Knowing 10% of retail holiday purchases are returned, set a plan for how to turn those returns into exchanges. It\u2019s critical to be \u201cfully locked into\u201d all transactions \u2013 across channels \u2013 to ensure upselling is possible. Finally, brands and retailers should set up post-mortem meetings to review lessons learned for next season. \u00a0 There are many forces seemingly working against retailers today, but they are not insurmountable. If brands take the time to make customers feel special, focus on convenience, employ technology as needed, and reengage customers after the holidays, they poised to emerge from the peak season on top."}

Authored by Katie Deighton | Reporter\nInvestments in benefits and overhauled onboarding programs aim to recover call center labor shortages, and fast. Alorica, which provides customer support centers for other companies, is one of a number of companies that raised minimum wages this year to compete for staff.\nThe average number of live job openings in call, contact and customer care centers advertised on Ziprecruiter.com in February was more than double that of the average the year earlier before the pandemic, according to the recruitment platform. The number of average job postings in November, meanwhile, was more than five times that of February 2020, according to the jobs board, which declined to disclose specific figures. \u00a0 Contact center bosses now are trying to reduce attrition rates by better cushioning the human impact of what can be a stressful, thankless job. Like their peers in hospitality, they are also raising wages, improving benefits and speeding up training.\n\u201cA lot of call centers have been really rethinking the way that they measure employees, but also the environment that they provide for them,\u201d said David Brodeur-Johnson, a principal analyst at Forrester Research Inc. \u201cIn a time when being able to find and hire people is so competitive, they\u2019ve had no choice but to.\u201d\nAlorica Inc., which provides third-party customer service support, offers different pay scales dependent on location, last year raised average minimum wages between 15% and 20% when it saw companies in other service industries do the same, said Colleen Beers, the company\u2019s president of North America and Europe operations. It also enlisted a TikTok employment influencer to drum up interest among younger potential recruits. To avoid losing staff in the first 90 days\u2014typically the period when the most workers leave\u2014the company directed managers to check in with new hires more often and via more channels than before, Ms. Beers said.\u00a0 \u201cWhether it\u2019s the phone, or on chat or email, I basically have to meet my employees where they want to be met,\u201d she said.\nThe tight call-center labor market cannot purely be attributed to resignations.

One local company is a good example.\nNear of the start of this year, the Alorica Call Center in Joplin, which provides in coming customer service information, wanted to expand it\u2019s workforce by 600 employees. Jeb Cook, senior manager of the facility, says the company is less than a hundred shy of meeting that new employee goal.\nSo in the middle of a pandemic when everyone seemingly is looking for employees, how has Alorica been able to hire so many? The business had to sweeten the pot in this employee centered job market.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found there\u2019s a whole new market of employees who are really interested in working from home, not only do they get flexibility on their breaks and lunches to be able to be there at home and make their own lunch, things like that on their breaks, and our wages have increased as well to $15 an hour,\u201d said Jeb Cook, Senior Manager, Alorica Call Center of Joplin.\nAnd once they get the new hires trained and in the system, they\u2019ve had to think out of the box to keep them.\n\u201cWe would go out and buy, you know, a thousand, two thousand hot dogs and hamburgers and we would go outside and grill it up and serve everybody a free lunch, but obviously with people working at home, we\u2019ve had to be dynamic in the way that we keep engagement with our employees, so we\u2019ve been looking at incentivizing them through bonuses and sending them things in the mail, just fun stuff like that to make sure that they feel appreciated,\u201d said Cook. And Cook says this approach may be the new normal, even after the pandemic passes.\n\u201cLife and health insurance, plus 401K, an employee assistance program and tuition reimbursement, make it very lucrative to come to work for Alorica,\u201d said Cook.\nTo read the full article go to: https://bit.ly/3ql1QPZ"}

Emergency savings, typically three to six months of expenses held in cash, is \u201cthe way to start someone with a saving habit.\u201d\u00a0SaverLife\u2019s 500,000 users include some who participate through employers. In July, KFC\u2019s nonprofit KFC Foundation began offering workers up to $240 over six months to match contributions to an emergency savings account.Regulators have been eyeing ways to remove barriers that make it difficult for employers to automatically enroll workers into emergency savings accounts, something the 2006 Pension Protection Act did in 401(k) accounts. Due to the widespread adoption of automatic enrollment in workplace retirement accounts, employee participation has risen dramatically in recent years.\u00a0This month, Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) introduced a bill to make it easier for employers to auto-enroll workers in emergency-savings accounts. (Workers would be able to opt out.) A bill sponsored by Sens. James Lankford (R., Okla.) and Michael Bennet (D., Co.) would allow workers one penalty-free annual withdrawal of up to $1,000 from a retirement account for emergency expenses. Employees would have to repay the money before taking another distribution.\u00a0The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently issued guidance employers can use to protect themselves against some liability when automatically enrolling workers in emergency savings accounts outside the 401(k).\u00a0Employers are responding to data that indicate workers are financially stressed.\u00a0 The Federal Reserve in 2019 reported that 37% of adults lack the funds to cover a $400 emergency. Nearly a quarter of the 11,000 respondents to a November 2020 Federal Reserve survey said they were worse off financially than a year before. Those who were laid off and people with less education were more likely to have fallen behind.\u00a0Record-keepers to 401(k) plans report that about 6% to 8% of account owners raided their retirement savings in 2020, up from 2% in a typical year.\u00a0Employers say workers who are stressed about money are often less productive. Among the 464 employers Willis Towers Watson surveyed, 34% said financial stress is creating workforce challenges such as absenteeism, up from 26% in 2017.\u00a0 Becky Dillon, 31 years old, said an emergency savings account she began funding in 2019 through a program sponsored by her employer, Alorica Inc., helped her family weather the recession. Ms. Dillon, who works for a call center in Bluefield, W.Va., said she initially hesitated to sign up. \u201cI was like, \u2018I don\u2019t need that. I can save money on my own,\u2019 until I remembered that I wasn\u2019t saving.\u201d\u00a0Ms. Dillon received a $20 deposit from her employer-sponsored program when she linked her bank account to the SaverLife platform.\u00a0She said she also received $240 in matching funds for saving about $600 over six months. The savings, which came in part from eliminating fast food and grew to about $1,000 before the pandemic, enabled her family to make ends meet when her husband, a mechanic, had his hours reduced.\u00a0Letisha Lamb, a senior human resources generalist at Alorica, said \u201ca large majority\u201d of the Bluefield workforce, which typically numbers up to 300, have participated in the savings program, which is available through a partnership with the call center\u2019s client,\u00a0Intuit\u00a0Inc.\u00a0She said 75% of participants have saved $500 or more.\u00a0Recently, Ms. Dillon amassed enough in her emergency account to purchase a computer.\u00a0\u201cEven saving a little bit can soften the blow of unexpected expenses,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been able to buy the computer, that would have put me into credit card debt and could have caused a big spiral downward.\u201d\u00a0To read the full article go to:https://on.wsj.com/3tZmQLR"}

Jeb Cook, Senior Team Manager at Alorica Joplin, says when the pandemic hit they shifted 80 percent of their employees to work-from-home. Since then, they\u2019ve noticed a few positives.\n\u201cOur employees are happy working from home. They\u2019re doing a great job taking care of their customers,\u201d says Cook. \u201cAs I said, it was something born out of necessity done at first, and we\u2019ve just had a great time with it.\u201d\nAccording to the latest data from the\u00a0U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 13.4 percent of employed people teleworked or worked from home in the last four weeks, with the main motivator being the pandemic. The highly contagious Delta variant has caused several big companies like Apple, Google, and Facebook to push back their timelines for bringing people back into the office to next year.\nMany businesses plan to adopt\u00a0a hybrid model, where employees come into the office at least two to three days a week if they don\u2019t end up going back to the status quo.\nFor businesses like Alorica and people like Laning though, remote work may very well be the way of the future.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true,\u201d says Laning. \u201cAnd that they pay really well\u2026 that\u2019s gonna be really beneficial for my family all the way around.\u201d\nSo far Alorica has filled 300 of the 600 work-from-home positions that are currently open.\nTo read the full article go to: https://bit.ly/3tJn5KV"}

To read the full article go to https://bit.ly/36CMgFf\u00a0Alorica, Inc., a global leader in customer experience, is providing Returning Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) with employment opportunities that come with competitive salaries, medical benefits, skills-enhancement training particularly in\nEnglish communications, online learning, and the opportunity to continue furthering their studies. This is part of Alorica\u2019s efforts to hire 4,000 new employees for its Philippine sites in the next few months to meet the high demand of the business.Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, over 58,000 OFWs have returned to the Philippines after losing their jobs temporarily or permanently (Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, July 21, 2020). Alorica is offering both agent and non-agent career\npaths for OFWs and thousands of Filipinos across the country looking for employment. For agent positions, new hires may progress as Subject Matter Experts or Team Leaders after six to 24 months of tenure, and potentially move up to Operations Manager\nafter 48 to 72 months of tenure. Meanwhile, non-agent career paths in the company include roles in recruitment, administration, human resources, training, and information technology.\u201cOFWs are experienced individuals who have been immersed in diverse environments with different employers. Apart from having the basic command of English, OFWs demonstrate adaptability, integrity, and commitment, which are important factors for\nanyone looking to build a career. OFWs are ideal members of our workforce as they are oriented in not only providing customer service, but also effective solutions,\u201d explains Bong Borja, Alorica\u2019s President of Asia-Pacific Operations.Estrella Bagni is a recent new hire at Alorica Davao, now working as a Customer Service Representative. The former househelp of a British family based in Qatar now finds herself resolving customer issues and concerns.\u201cAt first, I was overwhelmed, because working abroad is totally different from working at Alorica. My work abroad is mainly organizing and cleaning my employer\u2019s house, while at Alorica, I deal with customers\u2019 concerns and issues, which\nhelped expand my skill set,\u201d Bagni shares, citing the different training programs available to her to assist her in carrying out her new set of responsibilities. She emphasizes that working with Alorica has not limited her to doing the same\nthings every day, but it has expanded her opportunities to learn and develop other competencies.Analyn Quilapio is another former OFW who has found her place at Alorica as a Customer Service Associate in one of the company\u2019s Makati sites.\u201cAlorica made sure that we became experts before they onboarded us. They offer in-house training sessions that are informative and fun. They make sure that we are enjoying the work, while learning everything we need to know about our product or\naccount,\u201d she explains.\u201cAlorica is an ideal workplace for a returning OFW, because you will get to meet new people, make new friends, and enjoy what you do while earning a much higher rate than your salary abroad. Being employed in Alorica during the pandemic has really\nhelped my family to survive. Without it, for sure, my family would still struggle to make a living,\u201d Quilapio adds."}

Authored by Bruce Carlson | Publisher\nThe interplay of communication channels \u2013 websites, e-mail, video, podcast, social media, mass media, and, of course, interpersonal \u2013 is all the rage in consumer marketing today. Hundreds of millions of marketing dollars are being committed to these channels each year \u2013 and marketing spend is expected to grow by nearly 15 percent this year, according to Deloitte.\nYet, there\u2019s no playbook that provides reliable standards or practices to guide marketers for lone channels, let alone how to effectively juggle omnichannel communications. Given the omnichannel flurry of activity in pharma and the extraordinary constraints on life sciences commercial teams, how can the industry most effectively leverage omnichannel communications to connect with healthcare professionals (HCPs)? What can the life sciences industry learn from outsiders, like retail, where omnichannel practices have advanced further and much faster?\nTranslate the superior in-store experience to the online experience.\nIan Liu, VP of client services at Alorica, a leading contact center and digital customer experience provider, looks at what major retailers do for their customers. \"Retail giants are tracking their customers even as they arrive at the parking lot, tying their prior online experience to what information that customer might want when they enter the store,\" Liu explained. \"The goal is to create a model of the customer\u2019s entire journey, from online searching and social media activity to in-store customer behaviors.\nFor the life sciences industry, the obvious parallel here is to connect patient queries or online activity with their experience at the doctor\u2019s office. In a similar fashion, the online activity of an HCP can be connected to the interactions they have with sales reps or physician portals. In fact, social media is predicted to be the next major source of physician insights. According to a survey of more than 4,000 HCPs, nearly 70 percent use it for professional reasons. Further, Sermo reports two-thirds of physicians spend an average of two hours and 22 minutes on social media platforms a day.\nAI and machine learning will be critical to helping life sciences commercial teams orchestrate engagement across this mix of traditional and non-traditional channels. AI can quickly find patterns based on social media behavior to make suggestions. Natural language processing can capture valuable sentiment data from HCPs who are sharing content, retweeting articles, and commenting on news. In this way, HCPs are divulging attitudes, preferences, and interests via social \u2013 pharmaceutical companies that pay better attention will thrive.\nCreate product/service evangelists.\nLiu, who was formerly a pharmacist at a leading chain drugstore, sees valuable lessons for pharma in how the banking industry got its customers to adopt mobile banking, such as depositing checks through their phone. \"A few years ago, it was hard to believe that I could deposit a check from home on my laptop and then my phone,\" he said. \"Evangelizers were the key to getting broad consumer acceptance, especially younger people who showed their parents and their parents\u2019 friends how easy it was, and how freeing it was to be able to skip a trip to the bank.\"\nA similar transition has occurred in the travel and hospitality industry, where smartphones now make it fast and easy to buy concert or airline tickets, reserve hotel rooms, and more. \"We even use mobile phone \u2018keys\u2019 to enter our hotel rooms to streamline check-in,\" added Liu, \"but this became acceptable because of technology apostles like Millennials and Gen Z.\"\nIn the life sciences industry, evangelists often come in the form of key opinion leaders (KOLs), and emerging digital opinion leaders. This is also why it is so vital for commercial teams to proactively collaborate with medical science liaisons (MSLs) on omnichannel engagement strategies. MSLs are the bridge to KOLs. Pharmaceutical companies can leverage social media to identify KOLs more effectively \u2013 a process that is often very manual and inefficient. Analytical methods, such as graphing analysis, can be applied to social media datasets to help identify KOLs, plus emerging leaders, in their therapeutic areas who have the greatest and most widespread influence.\nTo read the original article, visit: https://bit.ly/3C4WEDL"}

Authored by Intelligent Sourcing with Mark Hillary | Writer and Analyst\nIt\u2019s still early in 2022, so there is just enough time to make a few predictions for the year ahead in CX.\nOne of the most important recent changes in this industry has been that fact that every major Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) company now has two years experience of most of their team working from home (WFH).\nThis flexibility is an important point. Who wants to get up early and commute to the same office everyday to work a long shift in a contact center and then commute home again in the evening? Companies are looking to create a more flexible and dynamic labor pool and the agents want to chop and change their working hours to fit around their life outside work.\u00a0The CX analyst Stephen Loynd talks at some length\u00a0about this subject in this podcast interview, where he suggests that more flexibility will be a requirement to attract the best talent.\nYou can\u2019t create this flexibility without a welcoming and inclusive corporate culture. People need to feel valued in terms of their compensation, but also their day to day work environment and career opportunities.\u00a0Alorica has recently earned several accolades\u00a0in the US that recognize their focus on diversity and opportunities for women \u2013 it\u2019s this approach to flexibility and diversity that needs to become normal throughout the industry.\nUltimately, the growth of CCaaS will lead to many companies embracing GigCX. This is where agents can flexibly access the virtual contact center \u2013 more can be online when needed and the numbers can be reduced for quiet periods. The gig agents are paid each time they help a customer, rather than hourly, and in most cases these workers are earning a lot more than most hourly-paid contact center agents.\nThe virtualization of the contact center did not begin with the pandemic, but technologies like CCaaS and GigCX are becoming popular because brands now want resilience and greater flexibility.\nTo read the original article, visit:\u00a0https://bit.ly/3tqf9zG"}

To read the full article go to\u00a0https://bit.ly/3iyhKRF\nWomen continue to prove that they can lead and succeed in their chosen field. Studies have shown that gender diversity in companies can boost productivity and profitability. For this year\u2019s Women\u2019s Month celebration, organizations around the world are consciously making an effort to break biases that hinder women from advancing in their careers, and in other endeavors they pursue.\nIn recent years, the Philippines has served as a model to the rest of the world for fostering an environment where women can have a voice, make critical decisions, and hold positions of influence. In many market studies, the country continues to rank highly for women in corporate leadership roles. According to Grant Thornton\u2019s annual Women in Business report, Filipinas holding senior positions in mid-market businesses reached 48% in 2020, surpassing the 30% minimum representation threshold. This is a great achievement amid COVID-19 greatly affecting local and international economies. This is also the result of the tireless efforts of female leaders in proving they too can significantly impact the overall value of businesses.\nAs the largest private employer in the country, the business processing outsourcing (BPO) industry\u00a0 has great potential to put women in leadership roles; currently women make up 55% of the BPO workforce in the Philippines. Alorica Inc., the 2021 Gold Stevie award winner for Employer of the Year, continues to drive programs that empower women and provide more opportunities for them to ascend, especially in fields where men are generally seen to dominate.\nThe company\u2019s Women\u2019s Initiative was launched in March 2018 to further enhance its culture of diversity and serve as an interactive forum for women to discuss and solve for diversity-related issues in the workplace. Additionally, with more than 61% of its global workforce comprised of women, Alorica was recently recognized by Comparably as a Best Company for Diversity and a Best Company for Women.\nStrong Filipina leaders paving the way in the BPO industry\nAlorica\u2019s Asia-Pacific (APAC) Senior Leadership Team serves as a testament that women are seen as equals in the corporate world. Alex Garcia (Vice President of Information Technology), Grace Taeza (Vice President of Finance Operations), Atty. Mikee Ong (Vice President and Associate General Counsel), and Sarah Marie Salva (Regional Director of Facilities and Real Estate) have all earned their place in their respective fields where men often take the helm. To their credit, they each have worked their way up to lead successful large-scale projects or policy improvement initiatives, and they have undoubtedly represented the region well in terms of competence and performance excellence.\nOvercoming biases and representing women professionals\nGarcia, who has been working in IT for over 20 years, knows first-hand that rising up in her chosen field did not come easy.\u00a0 \u201cI was always challenged in each and every meeting, both internally and externally, regardless of what organization or industry I was in. I had to constantly exert 200% effort in learning and understanding the technicalities of whatever IT discipline that I was with, so I could confidently, with firm and strong delivery, answer the hardcore technical questions being thrown at me on a daily basis,\u201d she said.\nTaeza also shares this experience, also having worked in the world\u2019s leading tech companies for decades. \u201cConfidence is our greatest asset. Will is power and it has no gender,\u201d she shares. \u201cIt is no longer true that women don\u2019t have a voice and are less heard. In whatever field, we can make our voice louder and louder until we are understood. Like men, we keep on pushing, we move with accuracy and speed and make things done. Equality should be creating the same opportunities between 2 or more competent individuals regardless of gender.\u201d\nFor her part, Salva has also shown that women can be a driving force at the negotiating table. She looks after multiple real estate contracts, and she has proven that gender should not be the measure of the quality of one\u2019s work. \u201cThings like attention to detail, being firm, assertive, yet still respectful are what matter more,\u201d she said, \u201cand over time, people listen to you because of your track record, and it will be just incidental that you happen to be a woman.\u201d\nAtty. Ong has also set an example in changing the game and proving doubters wrong. \u201cWomen leadership is often challenged on the basis of being allegedly weak, because we are seen as emotional, more empathetic, but I\u2019d like to argue that these are the very same traits that make us great leaders,\u201d Atty. Ong said. \u201cAs women, we should leverage our innate instinct to nurture and protect those placed in our care to catapult our team into collective greatness. Our inherent traits that are key to managing households and holding our families together even in challenging times are the same ones that are critical in creating and maintaining well-oiled organizations.\u201d\nAlorica, through its Women\u2019s Initiative, has already made a strong case in fostering an inclusive environment and a strong culture of diversity and empowerment, so women employees can maximize their overall potential. \u201cThankfully, Alorica is an organization that provides equal opportunity, regardless of gender,\u201d Garcia said. And with the company\u2019s projected expansion in 2022, there will be more opportunities for women to join and flourish in their careers.\nWhether it\u2019s in BPO or in any other industry, women are highly capable leaders when given the right tools and opportunities to learn and grow. This can be achieved through collective efforts to push for inclusive strategies that ensure equal and just outcomes for women, as well as men. As Atty. Ong aptly declared: \u201cLeadership is a team sport \u2013 the success of one is the success of all.\u201d\nOver the past year, Alorica Philippines\u2019 employee headcount increased by 30%, and the company continues grow its nationwide presence and hire for roles spanning customer experience operations and corporate support functions.

Authored by Colson Hillier\u00a0| Alorica CMO and Forbes Councils Member\nToday\u2019s consumer expectations are at an all-time high and marketplace demands are equally intense. As pressures rise to deliver premium service with greater efficiency and accountability, it\u2019s important to rethink approaches to achieving tangible business outcomes.\nAs a CMO, I am passionate about the value of strategic partnerships. Advancements in enterprise technology and collaborative operating models have made strategic business partnerships increasingly important to stay ahead of competition. Done well, strategic partners can lead to improved products, services and distribution, and result in higher profitability, focus and customer experiences. Done poorly, these engagements lack clarity, efficiency and results, and can lead to disjointed customer experiences. The key is focusing on the right business opportunity, selecting the right partner to complement your strategies and establishing the right execution model.\nStand for something, but partner outside your core.\nUnderstanding your company\u2019s core expertise allows you to focus on making that value proposition the best in its class. No business can specialize in everything, leaving the door open to partnerships that support and enable capabilities that supplement a company\u2019s core offerings. Whether your business is embarking on vertical or horizontal integration, the considerations are the same. The enterprises that come out on top will be those that explore strategic, mutually beneficial collaborations that differentiate service offerings, make operations more efficient and improve the value proposition to their customers.\nCombining forces with partners can optimize operating models and differentiate service offerings to propel a business forward. Oftentimes, this process requires expanding distribution channels, appealing to new target markets or reducing expenses, and can take form in several ways.\nShopify, which supplies the digital tools that have enabled countless companies to launch their business online, provides the infrastructure to efficiently scale online. An affiliate marketing engagement can add value for customers and promote loyalty, such as Lyft and Delta, whose\u00a0partnership gives ride-hailing passengers the ability to earn one airline mile for every $1 spent on a car ride\u00a0if they link their SkyMiles and Lyft accounts. Beyond enhancing services, partnerships can prove valuable in meeting marketplace challenges. The restaurant industry recognized this when it partnered with DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub and others for widescale food delivery. This not only brought new value to customers but\u00a0aided many restaurants financially\u00a0when they were otherwise forced to close during pandemic lockdowns.\nSeek partnerships with a clear alignment of incentives.\nMany companies have been built with the intention of being strategic partners to other businesses, whether that is a cloud-based service provider, ticketing system, CRM database or retail marketplace. There is already an entire economy built with the mindsight of enabling partners to innovate or operate more efficiently.\nA large number of businesses serve the same audiences, but with different strengths. Together, they can create natural partnerships for mutual benefit, such as with event venues and food service companies, technology providers and system integrators, or content owners and distributors. The key is to seek out those that deliver on business objectives and drive improved customer experiences.\nThe best partnerships are built around a common mission that is well understood and roles that are well defined. The shared pastimes of reading and drinking coffee converged in 1993 when\u00a0Barnes & Noble began exclusively offering Starbucks coffee\u00a0in its stores. More recently, buy now, pay later platform\u00a0Affirm entered into a strategic payments partnership with Amazon, giving Affirm an influx of new customers and Amazon another value-add for online shoppers. Yet, even seemingly unrelated partners can mutually benefit. After declaring bankruptcy in 2017,\u00a0Toys R Us found new life in a partnership announced with Macy\u2019s\u00a0last year. The store-within-a-store model outfits more than 400 Macy\u2019s locations with a Toys R Us-branded shop as the retailer looks to grow market ownership in the toy business.\nRecalibrate regularly.\nAs the pace of change continues to accelerate, partnerships will mature, and with that comes the need for regular checkups on each party\u2019s objectives, performance and satisfaction. Partnerships fail when there is mistrust or the joining of two companies requires a change to the focus or intent of one of the parties. Neither should have to perform unnatural acts in order to be successful. One of the greatest values of a partnership is that it is flexible\u2014when it doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t mean all is lost. A business can always reassess alternative partners or its build vs. buy strategy.\nFor example, eBay and PayPal at one point greatly benefitted each other as an e-commerce site and payment platform, but\u00a0the two companies eventually outgrew formerly shared objectives. AOL and Time Warner\u2014once the biggest merger in history\u2014disintegrated in less than a decade as differences in corporate culture, aspirations and missions\u00a0made the combined operations of the two companies simply untenable.\nAs with any long-term relationship, it is important in a partnership to define the mission and each party\u2019s role and responsibilities, and to regularly assess the partnership\u2019s value using measurable goals with well-defined criteria.\nWhether your company\u2019s goal is to grow revenue, expand its customer base, increase brand loyalty, enhance CX, spread out geographically or something else entirely, the demands of today\u2019s landscape require new approaches to navigate increasingly fragmented and evolving channels. Strategic partnerships, when operating in service to shared objectives and goals, can achieve these business outcomes. The time is now to transform together to ensure your business is competitive, sustainable and scalable.\nRead the full article at: https://bit.ly/3OLnGGa"}

Authored by Bob Violino | Contributing writer, CIO\nOrganizational reliance on the cloud is on the rise, so too are the difficulties of managing increasingly complex cloud strategies.\nThe dramatic shift to cloud services over the past few years has given organizations unprecedented flexibility and scalability, enabling them to forge ahead with digital transformation efforts. For many, it has also led to intermingled, complex strategies that threaten to take away some of the luster of the cloud.\nEnterprises don\u2019t typically deploy one cloud service and call it a day. They rely on multiple offerings from various vendors for everything from procuring key business applications to creating new development environments to running their entire IT infrastructure.\nThe multiple/hybrid cloud strategy can result in complexities and challenges that many IT and business leaders didn\u2019t see coming. And this can be made all the more difficult when various business departments and groups use the cloud without central IT\u2019s approval or knowledge.\nHere are some of the ways managing cloud environments is becoming more complex and challenging, and what organizations can do to succeed amidst these difficulties.\nControlling costs\nCloud costs can quickly spin out of control, especially when departments outside central IT add to the organization\u2019s overall cloud footprint. But because one of the main attractions of the cloud is the possibility of cost reduction, letting a multicloud strategy lead to runaway costs is especially unappealing for organizations.\nOne possible solution is to create a cloud governance program.\n\u201cGovernance is not a fixed process or tool,\u201d says Antonio Vazquez, CIO at business process automation platform provider Bizagi. \u201cGovernance programs can be structured and managed in many different ways, and they are critical to a successful cloud strategy. Moving to the cloud means that we need to manage change to reduce risk and cost, with governance as the top layer to facilitate that change.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a good idea to start small and then expand the governance plan, Vazquez says. Other best practices include partnering with cloud providers to get maximum value from their services, hiring people with cloud-related skills, moving toward DevSecOps methodologies for cloud-based development, and documenting and communicating the governance program properly.\n\u201cThis change in paradigm makes it very complex to navigate, and the only tool that we have is governance,\u201d Vazquez says. \u201cA strong governance plan that includes best practices like tagging, workload management,\u00a0RACI [responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed] matrix, rightsizing, cost management, security monitoring, etc., will provide the necessary tools to steer the boat and navigate complex cloud management.\u201d\nFragmented investments in cloud services without a clear enterprise strategy can turn into long-term cost and management challenges, says Sumit Johar, CIO at automation software provider Automation Anywhere. \u201cOn the business applications side, organizations are facing an explosion of SaaS [software-as-a-service] applications,\u201d he says. \u201cA decade ago, an organization may have used from 20 to as many as 50 apps. But now the average is 250-plus apps.\u201d\nSince subscription-based cloud applications don\u2019t need any IT infrastructure, a line of business such as human resources or marketing can buy their own, Johar says. \u201cCIOs must ensure that procurement of these applications goes through an IT-led vendor risk assessment process,\u201d he says. \u201cGoverning apps within an organization is becoming a greater challenge, and CIOs must put policies in place for business-led applications.\u201d\nAddressing cybersecurity risks\nAddressing security issues in the cloud has been a concern for IT leaders for some time. But as cloud environments become more complex, the challenge of protecting data and applications in the cloud is even greater.\n\u201cSecurity management has become one of the most critical issues for companies moving to the cloud,\u201d Vazquez says. \u201cOn top of that, the pandemic has brought higher complexity to the environment in terms of employee dispersion.\u201d\nAs a result, Bizagi has moved from a working model in which all employees were accessing on-premises systems from the office using a corporate network, to a model in which employees can work remotely, using any device, and access cloud resources.\n\u201cThis change in paradigm has to be addressed by approaching security from a different standpoint,\u201d Vazquez says. \u201cIn our case, the strategy is migrating to a cloud-based secure access service edge and zero-trust service model.\u201d\nAlthough Bizagi still has some legacy systems running on-premises or in a private cloud, the strategy has been to move most of its services to the public cloud, for applications including\u00a0CRM, billing, project management, and\u00a0ERP. It also uses the cloud for web platforms such as ecommerce and for its own low-code automation platform.\nPitney Bowes, a provider of mailing and shipping equipment, conducts continuous monitoring of its cloud configurations for security issues created by misconfiguration or policy violations, says James Fairweather, executive vice president and chief innovation officer.\n\u201cWe implement this scanning across the entirety of our cloud footprint, and link the output into our centralized security incident and event management system,\u201d Fairweather says.\nOne of the mechanisms the company uses to ensure security of products and services is a common security scorecard approach\u00a0that each team maintains, and that a senior team reviews with the application development team on a quarterly basis.\n\u201cThe use of a numerous automated scanning tools, a common \u2014 and automated \u2014 scorecard to show results, and imparting accountability to teams to own the outcomes and be part of a quarterly review of their scorecard all have led to a significant improvement in our security posture over the last several years,\u201d Fairweather says.\nWorking around the worker shortage\nLots of organizations are\u00a0continuing to deal with the \u201cGreat Resignation.\u201d\u00a0But in the case of IT jobs, often there is no one to resign because positions remain unfilled in the first place. Technology professionals, including those expert in areas related to the cloud, are in short supply while demand remains high.\nNevertheless, IT leaders need to find ways to\u00a0attract and retain people\u00a0who understand cloud architecture, service platforms, languages, application programming interfaces (APIs), cloud security, containers, data migration, and many other aspects of the cloud.\n\u201cManaging cloud environments is different than managing on-premises environments, and requires a diverse skill set,\u201d Johar says. \u201cCIOs must build a team with unique skills in addition to continuing to upskill and reskill IT teams to work in cloud environments.\u201d\nDealing with changes in responsibilities\nThe rise of the cloud in all its forms is changing virtually everything about the way IT operates, including the responsibilities of the CIO. If technology leaders and their teams stick to the traditional ways of doing things before the cloud became prominent, they might be heading for failure.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean IT management is no longer needed. In fact, with the growing complexity of multicloud strategies, IT\u2019s guidance is needed more than ever.\n\u201cThe CIO\u2019s role is changing from \u2018build and control\u2019 to \u2018guide and inspire,\u2019\u201d Johar says. \u201cOur new role requires us to allow citizen developers from business teams to share some of the traditional IT work with proper oversight from our IT team.\u201d\nAutomation Anywhere is a \u201ccloud-first\u201d company Johar says, and many of its customers are embracing the cloud version of its automation platform. \u201cTherefore, it\u2019s important to me that we also fully embrace cloud internally within our global organization, and tap into its benefits,\u201d he says.\nMost of the organization, including IT infrastructure, network services, and nearly all of its business functions across the company use SaaS applications as well as cloud infrastructure. As CIO, Johar has an opportunity to help enable these services and tame the complexity through strong leadership.\nManaging microservices\nAs\u00a0microservices\u00a0expand with the increase in cloud services, the complexity of managing them also increases, says Emily Lewis-Pinnell, who leads the cloud practice at consulting and IT services firm NTT Data Services. Rapid application advancements made possible by microservices require new approaches toward management, particularly as they continue to rapidly scale, she says.\nApplication sprawl can hinder innovation and productivity as well as create security risks if abandoned applications are not updated appropriately, Lewis-Pinnell says. \u201cBusinesses need to have a balance between adopting new technology and retiring the old, as well as strong management and organization, or their application footprint can quickly grow to be unmanageable,\u201d she says.\nNTT Data recently worked on microservices with online store builder Volusion. \u201cWe applied infrastructure-as-code [IaC] to two of the microservices in Volusion\u2019s ecommerce platform,\u201d Lewis-Pinnell says. \u201cIaC ensures that the same environment is reliably provisioned every time throughout the software development cycle, including test and production, allowing rapid deployment at scale with less risk.\u201d\nThe microservices are orchestrated in four Kubernetes clusters. The open-source IaC tool gave Volusion the ability to define those clusters, Lewis-Pinnell says. \u201cVolusion can now deploy Kubernetes clusters with a simplified, automated workflow, [ensuring] that each environment is built with a consistent, best-practice design,\u201d she says.\nEnsuring the cloud is driving actual business results\nThe more complex a cloud strategy gets, the more difficult it might be to determine the return on investment from the various services in use, or whether there\u2019s a return at all.\n\u201cHaving the ability to define workloads and architect the right provider to perform specific requirements has been crucial, in my experience,\u201d says Mike Clifton, executive vice president and chief information and digital officer at\u00a0Alorica, a provider of customer service outsourcing.\n\u201cI recommend thinking of your company like a puzzle, with numerous pieces that connect together to add value for the customer,\u201d Clifton says. In Alorica\u2019s line of business, the company has different actions coming into its environment and going out to its client\u2019s environment, be that authenticating, call tracking, or recording.\n\u201cFor example, our ability to successfully integrate voice functionalities into a customer-facing environment in the right language, in the right time and in the right channel, is table stakes for achieving real-world business outcomes, whether that\u2019s a positive product review, interest in a discount offer or even an upsell,\u201d Clifton says.\nSuccess with a complex cloud environment in this context is possible only by\u00a0brokering service level agreements (SLAs)\u00a0with cloud service providers that outline a clear set of deliverables, Clifton says. \u201cOnce you have the scalable infrastructure in place, you can begin to piece together all workflows without major risk of disruption,\u201d he says."}

Authored by Jack M. Germain | Reporter\nOnline gambling is at an all-time high in accessibility and popularity. But many betting app developers are rolling the dice blindly without addressing users\u2019 customer experience (CX) concerns.\nMore states in the U.S. are legalizing sports betting with legislation pending in many others. Major sports leagues such as the NFL and the PGA Tour are adding legitimacy to the organized sports betting space by securing high-profile gambling partners. Sportsbooks like FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM, and Caesars are expanding in concert.\nWith money on the line, literally, with betting apps, these companies have a heightened burden to provide customer support. That could well be a survival requirement since many of their online bettors have never previously gambled on sports, let alone placed bets via mobile apps.\nAppeasing Regulators\nSo far, sports betting platform rollouts in new states have been relatively seamless. Yet some obvious CX issues must be addressed before watchdogs and regulators step in.\nSports betting companies need to tackle four potential stumbling blocks:\nThe product is still new to many customers. Gambling companies need to clear up confusion on the legal methods of sports betting and drive confidence that bets will be paid out.\nMost sports betting companies are pushing mobile apps for daily usage and interaction, leaving a strong need for tech support to help with logins and payment issues.\nGeolocation issues are a major factor. If users are near bordering states where sports betting is illegal, their phones might mistake them for being in the wrong location and their bets will not go through.\nSeasonality. Major sporting events such as the Super Bowl, March Madness, The Masters, FIFA World Cup, and the World Series amplify betting activity. As a result, gambling companies must have robust CX infrastructures in place to handle increased seasonal demand.\nOne of the biggest challenges is volume projection and staffing due to the sector\u2019s rapid growth and lack of historical data, according to Chris Crowley, chief commercial officer for CX provider Alorica. A significant and continuous increase in users is coming from existing states, as well as new states legalizing sports betting apps.\n\u201cAs the user base increases there is an increase in transactions across voice, chat, and email \u2014 especially from new users and novice users of sports betting apps. The ability to develop the appropriate staffing models and to train the staff effectively is crucial to delivering an exceptional customer experience,\u201d he told CRM Buyer.\nBetting on Digital-First Stability\nAnother big test for the sportsbooks, noted Crowley, will be finding the bandwidth to handle peak seasons when major sporting events drive a flurry of betting activity.\nTo withstand scrutiny from regulators and watchdogs, these companies require trained staff who can work with customers across voice, chat, text, and email.\nLike other digital-first companies that are born highly focused on product, sports betting companies may not yet fully appreciate the need for tech support and account management,\u201d he cautioned.\nFor example, most sportsbooks rely on website FAQs to support their customers. Many of the new customers are gambling on sports for the very first time.\nCX is critical to handle these concerns because money is involved. Customers rightly want access to a support person when they spend money to get something in return, such as a bet to win or deposit to get a bonus or free bet.\nApp Speed Risky Business\nLogistically, the speed of the app interface makes betting easier. But it also increases the risk of mistakes, warned Crowley. That is why it is crucial to have knowledgeable and readily-available support offerings from live agents and automated channels.\nFierce competition to develop repeat customers makes CX crucial to this emerging market. Companies such as DraftKings, Caesars, BetMGM, and others are currently spending tremendous amounts of money to rapidly grow their user bases through aggressive marketing.\n\u201cTo get the necessary return on this investment, they must develop user loyalty as it is so easy for users to jump to another app. One poor service experience can turn a novice bettor off forever,\u201d said Crowley.\nAnother reason CX is important is sports betting has its own community and lingo. It can be unkind to newcomers who do not have a firm understanding of betting odds and how promotions work.\n\u201cA big issue surrounds where \u2018free\u2019 does not always mean free. Having a customer service team backed by a real CX strategy gives new users a lifeline to figure out the nuts and bolts of sports betting,\u201d he explained.\nDriving Factors\nSocial acceptance of sports betting is now common. State governments increasingly are becoming supportive of the industry.\nAdditionally, with the rise of second screens, sports fans have found new online communities that share their love of the game, Crowley noted. Fans today are often on Twitter and Reddit while watching their teams play, reading and reacting to what other people have to say about the game.\nThis further encourages fan engagement. Online sports betting has benefited from the influence of social media and, to an extent, cord-cutting, which has evolved the way we consume sports, Crowley observed.\n\u201cAs sports betting gains wider social acceptance and state legalization continues, the industry will rapidly grow. For many, sports betting has become synonymous with watching and attending sports events,\u201d he said.\nIn a short period of time, this will be an ingrained part of our social norms. The number of American adults betting on sports doubled in the last year alone. It is crucial that companies in this sector invest in a robust CX operation and explore strategic partnerships with vendors that can keep customer engagement impactful, secure, and scalable, urged Crowley.\nMorphing World of Rules and Regs\nThe regulatory environment is rapidly changing in the mobile sports betting industry and online gambling.\nOverall, online sports betting platforms are progressing with new functionality at breakneck speeds due to the fast changes in state regulations and requirements. Most of the major sportsbooks and online sites are still in the process of obtaining required licenses in recently-legalized states.\nThe Supreme Court decision in Murphy v. NCAA gave states the ability to pass their own sports betting legislation. Some 30 states \u2014 plus D.C. \u2014 have legalized sports betting with 22 legalized for mobile and online sports betting. Twelve states have active or pre-filed legislation on the ballot for 2022.\nState laws vary greatly. Regulations range from betting in onsite casinos versus mobile/online to the age of bettors. Restrictions cover the types of bets, such as collegiate sports versus pro contests. Tax rates vary by state also.\nSome states allow tribal and commercial casinos. Others like Oregon, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island only allow one or the other, or a state lottery commission runs the betting.\n\u201cLike any consumer-facing industry, there are also protections around personally identifiable information,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cAs sports betting and mobile/online wagering become more common across different state jurisdictions, the landscape will only continue to evolve.\u201d\nOn Deck, Real-Time Customer Service\nOnline sports betting requires unambiguous fairness and transparency. The entire customer journey should be shepherded by a customer support offering that can resolve issues in real time.\nThe typical response time so far is 24 to 48 hours later for some betting companies, according to Crowley.

Authored by Martha Heller | Columnist\nCIDO Mike Clifton explains how, in addition to managing the IT core, he and his teams are enabling the company\u2019s go-to-market strategy, accelerating its digital roadmap, and using AI and ML to transform customer experiences.\nAlorica is a privately-owned and operated provider of customer experience solutions to Fortune 500 and digitally-native companies, and employs approximately 100,000 people globally. The company operates a global hybrid model\u2014both on site and through a work-at-home platform\u2014and provides a range of solutions from customer care to financial solutions and customized digital services. As such, the company has been \u201cdigital\u201d for some time.\nStill, like most companies, Alorica is in the midst of a digital pivot, says Mike Clifton, who joined Alorica as CIO in August 2021 and was promoted to chief information and digital officer just three months later. Recently, I caught up with Clifton to learn more.\nMartha Heller: How is Alorica pivoting as a business right now?\nMike Clifton:\u00a0Today, our clients are after a level of customer insight that requires a very deep knowledge of customer service transaction paths. Our clients would also like to provide more self-service to their customers, which means that at Alorica, we need to automate more transactions and learn more from those insights.\nThink about our service offerings as a pyramid. At the bottom of the pyramid, the widest layer, is voice. When you call a customer service line, you will answer a few quick prompts, but you are trying to get to a voice as quickly as you can.\nThe middle layer is automation, which includes look-up capabilities and voice capture tools.\u00a0 Then, at the top of the pyramid, is full automation with AI-driven conversation capabilities. This is where the machines become smart enough to respond naturally and appropriately human.\nAlorica\u2019s pivot is to invert the pyramid. Voice, which is the most expensive service to provide, becomes the top of the pyramid, the narrow point. It is tailored and offered as a top-tier service. At the bottom of the pyramid are conversational capabilities that interact like a human. We can take what we\u2019ve captured digitally to start driving real value at the second layer, which is full automation and where the machine starts to self-learn. So rather than voice first, it\u2019s voice last with conversational AI as the customer\u2019s point of entry. The whole inverted pyramid creates a closed-loop customer interaction.\nWhy is this pivot important to your customers?\nThe pandemic accelerated a change to digital interactions that was already happening in the market. Our market shifted quickly from in-store purchasing to a highly digital, interactive model, where the customer expectation is to transact everything online. You can buy a new car with six clicks and it shows up in your driveway. Since our customers, many of which are Fortune 500 and digital-first global companies, represent a huge segment of the consumer market, we had to accelerate our digital offerings accordingly.\nHow should CIOs who need to digitize their customer service get started?\nStart by looking at all of your customer touchpoints. What are the major channels you use to talk to your customers? What data do you collect from those channels? Then look at the customer interaction spots that have lower\u00a0NPS scores (Net Promoter Score). Use those gaps to drive differentiated digital offerings.\nBut even before that, you have to look at your core platform. If you have a legacy platform, you\u2019re dealing with wrappers. You are better off with a greenfield cloud platform, because it will already have services. Starting new seems like it would cost more, but in the end, it costs less.\nFinally, make sure you understand your data, because no machine learning solution will work for you if you aren\u2019t working with the right data. Data lakes have a new consumer in AI.\nYou are both CIO and chief digital officer. How do those roles work together?\nAs CIO, I manage the IT core: security layers, data center operations, cloud capability enablement, and architecture\u2014everything you would find in a typical CIO organization.\nBut Alorica is highly instrumented digitally because of our work-at-home model and how we capture voice. Many of our service-based offerings include hosting and executing our customers\u2019 omnichannel platforms. So, in addition to running IT, I manage the operations that deliver service levels, including measurement criteria and target outcomes.\nMy combined job is to design and run an operating model that requires IT services, and leverage those to enable a go-to-market strategy, all as part of accelerating our digital offerings.\nHow are you operationalizing this dual role?\nWe\u2019ve created a digital business center (DBC), which includes people across the enterprise, including\u00a0product managers, sales leaders,\u00a0business analysts,\u00a0architects, and developers. This group, which is separate from IT and is its own P&L, designs and delivers our new product and service capabilities. IT is a consulting service to the DBC, which is charged for the IT resources it consumes.\nThe architecture team spans both models\u2014IT operations and services\u2014so that there is a tight connection between IT and the DBC. This is a consultative model that includes allocations and time management to enable the delivery of the digital business, as well as strategic projects like next-generation cloud platforms.\nWhat are the qualities you would look for in your successor?\nAt the core is someone who is both technically savvy and thinks strategically about the future, and about how technology will be disruptive.\nThe second is the ability to tell a compelling story. Years ago, I used to enroll my senior IT team in sales training classes, because they could not articulate the why, only the how. If you can translate the highly technical into a compelling story, you will inspire people to understand and sell the value it brings to the company.\nFinally, I would look for someone who inspires decision making and supports failure. If you don\u2019t create an ecosystem where failure is an accepted part of the process, then highly strategic people will not want to work for you.\nWhat advice do you have for CIOs in pursuing the go-to-market CDO position?\nBe prepared when people still think of the CIO as a delivery person, and they want to put you back in your box. You need a strong lead line into the market, because you have to understand the pulse to know if your strategy will meet market demands. The market is evolving faster than it ever has before. If you miss what the market needs, you could wind up driving the wrong strategy.\nIf you are a delivery CIO, and you\u2019re tapped to lead go-to-market strategy, then change your organization. Create an integrated team, like the DBC, to make sure you have a pulse on your customers. Set up very agile delivery teams, and productize as much as you can so that you can rinse and repeat across the enterprise.\nIf you are a CIO who has had a lot of market-facing interaction, it will be easier for you to transition into a CDO role. The big difference is that a CDO drives a business, which needs to produce growth, results, and margin. When you move from CIO to CDO, you are going from cost center to a high-growth business center. That\u2019s a big change.\nRead the original article at :\u00a0https://bit.ly/38Faqmb"}

Authored by Mike Prokopeak | Editor in Chief\nEffective collaboration\u00a0across dispersed teams is one of the most challenging problems facing organizations today. This is particularly true of hybrid work models, where many companies have yet to precisely define how, where and when work will take place.\nThe problem, according to a\u00a0paper by McKinsey, is that many organizations have yet to think through what hybrid means. According to the paper,\u00a0while many companies have a theoretical notion of the work model, they still have not worked out specifics. As a result, employees are feeling anxious about what comes next and what that will mean for their day to day at the company.\nWithout clear guidelines on how teams on- and off-premises are expected to operate, the question is whether workers in these two models can really collaborate or if they will, in reality, operate like two separate organizations. Leaders hoping to adopt a hybrid model long term stand to gain from carefully mapping out what that means \u2014 and communicating it clearly to employees.\nInvest in\u00a0Collaboration Technology\nFor true collaboration to occur, senior executives have to put the resources in place to encourage individuals and teams to work effectively with one another. When working remotely, those resources include communications and other cloud-based applications that enable disparate employees and teams to collaborate across different channels, such as chat, video/VOIP calls, document archives and other technologies.\nWhen employees are in the office, this means having equipped spaces such as conference rooms outfitted with traditional or electronic whiteboards where teams can meet, discuss projects and conduct brainstorming sessions. In a hybrid world, however, leaders must also ensure that these two environments don't operate in a silo and the tools used remotely and in-office work together.\n\u201cAlthough there are many considerations to make, it all starts at the top of each company and each firm's management team sets the tone with how much they value (or don't value) collaboration and their investment to make it happen every day of the week ... regardless of where employees are working,\u201d said Mike Clifton, chief information and digital officer at Irvine, Calif.-based\u00a0Alorica.\nRead the full article at: https://bit.ly/3NVfMZz"}

Authored by Yitzi Weiner | Founder & Editor.\nFor starters, any leader must recognize that change is inevitable, and the future is unpredictable, no matter how much time and energy we devote to forecasting and looking ahead. Based on this beginning principle, one can be prepared for different forms of change if you plan for them. It\u2019s a case of: if this happens, then we, as a company, will take\u00a0this action\u00a0or we will respond\u00a0this way. A great leader runs through these scenario-specific plans so that if and when something unpredictable happens, he\u2019s not caught completely caught off guard. More importantly, he\u2019s already formulated a strategy for dealing with that specific event, so related leadership decisions come a little easier.\nAs part of our series about the \u201cFive Things You Need To Be A Highly Effective Leader During Turbulent Times\u201d, we had the pleasure of interviewing Greg Haller.\nGreg is an experienced senior executive with a proven track record of delivering benchmark results and driving shareholder value, with a strong foundation of strategic thinking, operational excellence, and people and culture development, all anchored in integrity.\nHe has significant expertise in leading multiple distribution channels, creating, developing and executing strategic initiatives, and fostering client relationships and P&L ownership.\nGreg is passionate about winning and driving the business forward by attracting and developing the best talent, motivating that talent to deliver on their potential, and finding new and innovative ways to create world-class customer and employee experiences.\nThank you so much for your time! I know that you are a very busy person. Our readers would love to \u201cget to know you\u201d a bit better. Can you tell us a bit about your \u2018backstory\u2019 and how you got started?\nIn1989, I started working at Cellular One, one of America\u2019s earliest nationwide wireless carriers, as a business sales executive right after I graduated from Wittenberg College in Ohio. From that entry-level role, I steadily advanced my way up through the company, relocating three times, seeing multiple ownership changes, and working in nearly a dozen different roles over the course of 29 years. I owe much of my business acumen and success to those days at Cellular One, and I utilize the lessons I learned there every day.\nCan you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lessons or \u2018take aways\u2019 you learned from that?\nIn my first week on the job at Cellular One, my regional president wanted to accompany me on sales appointments, but he didn\u2019t give me any advance notice. Because I was so new to both the role and the company, I hadn\u2019t had the opportunity yet to schedule any sales appointments, so we went cold calling instead and literally knocked on companies\u2019 doors prospecting for new accounts. During one stop, the president and a small business owner got into a very heated argument about the safety of cellular phones. It was ugly! Needless to say, that was a very long day for both of us. The key takeaways: always be prepared, have a plan every day, and be more selective where you cold call with the boss.\nNone of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story?\nThere are, literally, dozens of people who helped me along the way, and prepared me to be the senior executive I am today. One professional stands out in my mind. Carol McDowell, my manager at Cellular One when I first started out in Dayton, Ohio, was the person who gave me confidence early in my career and prompted me to push myself further, continue working hard, be diligent and vigilant, and always be asking smart questions. I\u2019m extremely grateful to Carol for teaching me many insightful lessons in my career\u2019s formative years that proved to be valuable as I move into more challenging roles.\nExtensive\u00a0research\u00a0suggests that \u201cpurpose driven businesses\u201d are more successful in many areas. When your organization started, what was its vision, what was its purpose?\nWhen Alorica founder Andy Lee started the company in 1999, he believed there were better ways brands could deliver superior customer service and technical support, two important business functions that have proven to be critical to the success\u2026and failure\u2026of many companies. With that in mind, he set out to create a high-performing global enterprise, with the supporting infrastructure and cutting-edge technologies needed, whose sole purpose was to help brands take their customer service operations to the next level\u2026to the point where they become competitive advantages. In recent years, Alorica has evolved its focus to \u201ccreating insanely great experiences for customers everywhere,\u201d and that is the company\u2019s current purpose. In addition, it\u2019s our corporate mantra that we embrace every day and every challenge with passion, performance, and possibilitiesTM. We love this credo so much, we trademarked it (as you can see). Simply stated, some see the sky as the limit; we see it as a steppingstone.\nThank you for all that. Let\u2019s now turn to the main focus of our discussion. Can you share with our readers a story from your own experience about how you lead your team during uncertain or difficult times?\nIt\u2019s important to provide clear, frequent communication to keep the team focused on the job at hand. Helping people understand that moving with purpose\u00a0and\u00a0delivering accuracy are necessary, and both are extremely important. You really can\u2019t have one without the other, and still be successful. In a crisis, people will work hard, so you have to be sure to acknowledge their efforts. In addition, in uncertain times, employees need to be reassured that senior management has their best interests in mind; their concerns are legitimate, heard and taken seriously; and that there is a path forward. That is where the frequent communication really comes into play. And it\u2019s not just communication, per se. It has to be real, authentic and pointed communication, the type of interactions the world\u2019s best leaders have employed throughout history to get their constituents through difficult times.\nDid you ever consider giving up? Where did you get the motivation to continue through your challenges? What sustains your drive?\nNo way; giving up has never even crossed my mind, nor has it ever been a consideration for me! In business, as in life, you should expect you\u2019re going to run into many challenges along the way. It\u2019s a given; a virtual certainty. It\u2019s important to remember that no matter how big the challenge, it usually is only temporary, never permanent. Of course, it may take some time to overcome that obstacle, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s ever going to be an enduring fixture in your personal life or your career.\nI\u2019m an author and I believe that books have the power to change lives. Do you have a book in your life that impacted you and inspired you to be an effective leader? Can you share a story?\nEvery year at Verizon, the CEO would ask us to read several books in preparation for our leadership meetings. Two in particular I still reference are\u00a0The Elephant and the Dragon\u00a0by Robyn Meredith and\u00a0Good to Great\u00a0by Jim Collins. Both tomes offer lessons about the importance of guiding a company to reach beyond its potential and focus on the key talent that will get you there.\nWhat would you say is the most critical role of a leader during challenging times?\nDuring challenging times, the most critical role of a leader is to be a strong, authentic communicator. It also helps to be an active listener.\nWhen the future seems so uncertain, what is the best way to boost morale? What can a leader do to inspire, motivate and engage their team?\nDuring a crisis, it\u2019s common for employee morale to take a serious dip because of all the F.U.D. (fear, uncertainty and doubt) out there, a lot of which is spread through the rumor mill. Therefore, one of the best ways to boost morale is, as I\u2019ve previously stated, to communicate with the workforce frequently, honestly and directly. It\u2019s important to take a reassuring, but factual, tone, and remind them that their hard work during these times is even more important to the success (and often the survival) of the company. I work with my fellow senior executives and my HR organization to help me craft these messages, and to arrange departmental meetings in which I can personally interact and engage with employees, and reiterate those motivational messages.\nWhat is the best way to communicate difficult news to one\u2019s team and customers.\nThe best way to communicate difficult news to any group of stakeholders is to be genuine, honest and direct. It\u2019s important to prepare what you\u2019re going to say beforehand and provide the reasoning for the difficult news. Additionally, showing empathy and bringing a sense of support is helpful for those with whom you\u2019re sharing that difficult news.\nHow can a leader make plans when the future is so unpredictable?\nFor starters, any leader must recognize that change is inevitable, and the future is unpredictable, no matter how much time and energy we devote to forecasting and looking ahead. Based on this beginning principle, one can be prepared for different forms of change if you plan for them. It\u2019s a case of: if this happens, then we, as a company, will take\u00a0this action\u00a0or we will respond\u00a0this way. A great leader runs through these scenario-specific plans so that if and when something unpredictable happens, he\u2019s not caught completely caught off guard. More importantly, he\u2019s already formulated a strategy for dealing with that specific event, so related leadership decisions come a little easier.\nIs there a \u201cnumber one principle\u201d that can help guide a company through the ups and downs of turbulent times?\nIntegrity. It is the most important value we possess. Having it questioned or challenged is highly damaging to your personal and corporate reputations.\nCan you share 3 or 4 of the most common mistakes you have seen other businesses make during difficult times? What should one keep in mind to avoid that?\nMake decisions that are not transparent and put people\u2019s integrity in question. Refuse to own your mistakes and blame others instead. Stop communicating and go radio silent.\nIt\u2019s important for any professional to own his mistakes. Take what comes next and move on, and then rally the team to pick you up. In difficult times, employees need to hear and see leaders throughout the organization.\nHere is the primary question of our discussion. Based on your experience and success, what are the five most important things a business leader should do to lead effectively during uncertain and turbulent times? Please share a story or an example for each.\n1. Open, honest, direct and frequent communication.\n2. Be seen, heard and accessible.\n3. Operate with integrity.\n4. Reassure employees and listen to their concerns.\n5. Rely on your team to navigate troubled waters.\nCan you please give us your favorite \u201cLife Lesson Quote\u201d? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?\n\u201cYour career is a marathon, not a sprint.\u201d Once I comprehended that fully, and started focusing on getting better in my current role and mastering it, opportunities came to me when I was truly ready versus when I thought I was ready.\nHow can our readers further follow your work?\nYou can follow me through Alorica\u2019s social media channels, or via my\u00a0LinkedIn profile.\nThank you so much for sharing these important insights.

We\u2019re discovering strategies and steps employers and employees can take together to live well and to work well.As a part of this series, we had the pleasure of interviewing Colleen Beers.Colleen Beers is the Chief Administrative Officer at Alorica, a trusted global leader in next-generation customer experience (CX) solutions. Colleen brings proven experience driving operational excellence and building Alorica\u2019s award-winning culture and employee experience.Thank you for making time to visit with us about the topic of our time. Our readers would like to get to know you better. Tell us about a formative experience that prompted you to change your relationship with work and how work shows up in your life.Well, I have six kids, so finding a balance between family and work was something I had to learn very quickly. One of the ways I do this, especially since I\u2019ve moved into more demanding, higher positions, is managing my calendar wisely. Whether\nI\u2019m working a 10-hour day or travelling, there are still family moments I need to schedule. And equally important is blocking off time to think. If you don\u2019t give yourself item to think, you\u2019re going to be exhausted, and the quality\nof your work, your ability to lead and your mental state will decline. This is why I put separate time blocks for my work, my family and just for me all on the same calendar. Then, at the end of each week, I assess what went well, what didn\u2019t\nand which areas I need to devote more time the following week.Harvard Business Review predicts\u00a0that wellness will become the newest metric employers will use to analyze and to assess their employees\u2019 mental, physical and financial health. How does your organization define wellness, and how does your organization measure wellness?As an organization, we don\u2019t define wellness as one thing or dictate how it needs to be managed for everyone because it\u2019s different for each employee. And as the environment around us is constantly changing, so is each employee\u2019s idea\nof what wellness means to them.That also means the way we measure wellness is constantly changing. We are currently exploring the best way to measure wellness globally so that it evolves with our individual employees. We\u2019re working with a third-party wellness provider to augment\nour 360-view of our employees. They are helping us identify what types of wellness our employees want from us, where and when we should engage and how to measure success. We are in the initial stages of collecting data and learning from employees\nthrough surveys and focus groups.Through this initial data collection, we have learned the biggest priorities for our employees are flexibility in scheduling and having a voice to express themselves. We have already begun implementing programs where our employees\u2019 needs can be\nmet. Our workforce management team works to create a schedule that meets each individual employee\u2019s needs whether that\u2019s working nights, working from home or only certain days a week. The cornerstone of our DEI program TIDE \u2014 Together\nfor Inclusion, Diversity and Equity \u2014 is our Real Talk sessions. These employee-led, interactive forums allow Aloricans to come together and discuss social issues that matter most to them and their communities.Based on your experience or research, how do you correlate and quantify the impact of a well workforce on your organization\u2019s productivity and profitability?Wellness directly impacts retention. When employees feel supported, they stay with their company. And they don\u2019t just stay; they also perform better while they\u2019re there. Happy employees deliver insanely great customer experiences, which results\nin happy clients and ultimately increases our bottom line.One way we measure employee satisfaction frequently is through eNPS (employee net promoter score). We also conduct daily pulse checks to measure employee confidence and well-being. When an employee rates low on either of these, it alerts their manager\nto check in and determine the best way to support the individual. We believe great leadership and mentorship are key to wellness, and in turn, productivity and profitability.Even though most leaders have good intentions when it comes to employee wellness, programs that require funding are beholden to business cases like any other initiative.\u00a0The World Health Organization estimates\u00a0for every $1 invested into treatment for common mental health disorders, there is a return of $4 in improved health and productivity. That sounds like a great ROI. And, yet many employers struggle to fund wellness programs that seem to come \u201cat the cost of the business.\u201d What advice do you have to offer to other organizations and leaders who feel stuck between intention and impact?My biggest advice? Don\u2019t get stuck! Take action! But since that is easier said than done, here are a few steps you can follow to help get your wellness program off the ground:First, ask to pilot a program \u2014 start small \u2014 and then grow from there. There will still be an initial investment, but it\u2019ll be taking baby steps rather than making a big move.Next, adapt! Every business, every employee is different. What works for one company may not work for you. As you learn what works best, adapt your program to reflect that.Finally, prove your ROI. Measure your success and take those numbers from your pilot to leadership and show them just how profitable the program truly is.As leaders, it\u2019s our responsibility to advocate for your employees and make things happen. It\u2019s also what our higher-ups hired us to do. So, stay curious and persistent and go shatter that status quo!Speaking of money matters,\u00a0a recent Gallup study reveals\u00a0employees of all generations rank wellbeing as one of their top three employer search criteria. How are you incorporating wellness programs into your talent recruitment and hiring processes?Wellness programs within recruitment and hiring are nothing new. They\u2019ve always been there. The concept might be new in terms of prioritization, but you\u2019ve always had to show flexibility and a focus on employee wellness in the interview.For Alorica, we make wellness a part of each point on the employee\u2019s career journey from the interview to orientation to training to their first 90 days and beyond. Each leader within the journey (recruiters, frontline managers, trainers, etc.)\nis responsible for reminding employees of the wellness programs offered at each milestone. That communication is critical. It\u2019s important to not just weave in wellness upfront then forget about it along the journey. Employees won\u2019t remember\nwhat you offer, and most importantly, their needs can change. Someone who needs help with flexible scheduling at the beginning of their career journey may later need therapy. Or maybe someone needs help opening a bank account then later wants to attend\na cooking class to learn to eat healthier. The point is, if you just tell employees of the programs offered once, they may utilize the one they need right then but later down the road when their needs change, they won\u2019t know where to go. That\u2019s\nwhy it\u2019s important to keep employees engaged and reminded of wellness offerings year-round, whether they\u2019ve been with the company 1 month or 10 years.One of the ways we do this is through our gamified app called Connect where employees go to view training assignments, company news, take their daily pulse checks and see all the amazing wellness programs we offer and how to participate.We\u2019ve all heard of the four-day work week, unlimited PTO, mental health days, and on demand mental health services. What innovative new programs and pilots are you launching to address employee wellness? And, what are you discovering? We would benefit from an example in each of these areas.Mental Wellness:\u00a0Our Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and the third-party wellness company we partner with both bring a variety of programs. For example, we are piloting on-demand therapy worldwide. In some countries we operate\nin, including the U.S., our EAP offers six sessions per incident for each employee. We also provide onsite counseling when events occur at our sites, such as the death of a coworker or a natural disaster in the local community.Emotional Wellness:\u00a0We also focus on the relationship between an employee and their direct supervisor. These managers provide mentorship and emotional support. We encourage our leadership to not just check on an employee\u2019s\nperformance but their overall wellbeing. I recently launched a global program where I held panel discussions on the topic of servant leadership and taught our managers how to care for the whole employee including emotional wellness.Our Employee Experience (HR) team is also highly engaged with employees and continues to build that culture where employees can lean on each other in times of need. This includes the abovementioned Real Talk sessions where employees discuss topics that\nare weighing on them emotionally and get support. We are seen as a safe place for employees, and this comes from our commitment to transparency. We acknowledge the political landscape and offer resources for those troubled by current events. In Real\nTalk sessions, employees discuss sensitive matters such as racism, stereotypes, sexual orientation and more. Just by being able to discuss these things in a place where this is typically considered taboo, the employees are building their emotional\nwellness.One of our greatest sources of pride at Alorica is our partnership with non-profit Making Lives Better with Alorica (MLBA). MLBA provides financial assistance to Alorica employees and their communities for medical bills, rent and utilities, funeral expenses,\ncrisis relief and more. Through this program, employees see that we truly care about their emotional wellness and will do anything to help them succeed. Learn more about our accomplishments through MLBA in our 2021 Impact Report.Social Wellness:\u00a0Part of social wellness is about building connections with coworkers. That\u2019s what we do during our Real Talk sessions. Even those on opposing sides of topics or issues come together to learn from each other.\nAlso, we recently piloted Connection Clubs \u2014 Alorica\u2019s affinity groups as part of our TIDE program. These small groups share a common interest/cause/identity, such as working parents, LGBT+, or even a love of cooking, creating a bond beyond\nwork.We also build connection through awareness holidays such as Pride Month, Women\u2019s History Month, Black History Month, AAPI Heritage Month, etc. and even through light celebrations, such as World Ice Cream Day or International Pet Day. Celebrating\nthese topics is not just fun but brings diverse cultures together.We regularly host contests where employees submit pictures of their home gardens, their favorite vacations, their family, what they\u2019re grateful for and more. We then share these photos globally to make our big world just a little bit smaller.As part of MLBA, sites hold fundraising activities like school supply drives, cleaning up local parks, painting rooms in foster group homes or even our most recent \u201cvote for which leader you want to see participate in the ice bucket challenge\u201d\ninitiative that took place in Joplin, Missouri. Coming together for a good cause builds these connections further between coworkers and improves social wellness.Physical Wellness:\u00a0We send global tips monthly about ways you can care for your body including planting your own vegetable garden, taking a walk between calls and even doing desk-ercise.Our team in the Philippines led a Zumba class and recorded it to share worldwide. At our site in Puebla, Mexico, the team holds yoga classes to balance the body and mind. Our site in Panama has its own soccer team. Many sites have gyms and meditation\nrooms available as well.We are launching a global wellness calendar soon that will offer cooking classes, exercise classes, support for eating healthy and more.Financial Wellness:\u00a0We partner with financial institutions around the globe that hold classes to learn how to invest, how to open a bank account, how to take out loans and more. We also have a partnership with PayActiv where employees\ncan choose to be paid weekly or even daily. Our Philippines team hosts its own financial wellness seminars frequently, and we plan on holding even more globally through our global wellness calendar.In Bluefield, West Virginia, we partner with Intuit to provide a savings program through SaverLife where employees develop financial planning skills to build a $500 nest egg of savings with assistance from a company match. Currently, we have all 183 onsite\nemployees participating in the program.Our financial assistance through MLBA also improves our employees\u2019 financial wellness by alleviating the stress of past due bills and unforeseen circumstances.Can you please tell us more about a couple of specific ways workplaces would benefit from investing in your ideas above to improve employee wellness?Retention: Like I said earlier, happy employees stay with their companies longer.eNPS: By investing in your employees\u2019 wellness, you increase employee satisfaction.Referrals: Happy employees invite their friends and family to come work at the company that is taking such great care of them.Productivity: An employee who feels drained works slower and with less efficiency. When their well-being is taken care of, they can better focus on their job.Performance: Similar to the above, happy employees are more encouraged to perform at their best.Communication and Trust: This outcome is most important to us at Alorica. When employees know that you care about them, they feel more open to come to you to work through problems instead of just leaving the company or suffering in silence.Client Satisfaction and Testimonials: When employees are happy, they are better equipped to serve customers, resulting in happy clients.How are you reskilling leaders in your organization to support a \u201cWork Well\u201d culture?In the first half of the year, we enrolled over 10,000 learners in Alorica Academy, our global training and leadership development program. These classes are for frontline leaders, such as team managers and operations managers, and are built on our Global\nLearning team\u2019s commitment to put our people at the center of the circle.We have programs at each stage of the employee life cycle; our\u00a0Step-Up\u00a0programs prepare high potential employees for the next stage in their career; first time leaders and those advancing to higher level roles go through our\u00a0New to Position Training\u00a0which\nfocuses on the transition to a leadership role and emphasizes the importance of key behaviors such as empathy, self and social awareness in all their interactions; our\u00a0Foundations Series\u00a0is all about reinforcing these behaviors,\nconsistency and overall, how to be a good human being. That is what our culture at Alorica is all about.All these programs focus on leading by example. Leaders who put wellness at the forefront create future leaders who do the same. And this goes for a first-level manager all the way to our C-Suite. Each leader is taught and encouraged to put their direct\nreports\u2019 well-being at the center, building our culture of wellness.Ideas take time to implement. What is one small step every individual, team or organization can take to get started on these ideas \u2014 to get well?It all starts at the top \u2014 and senior leaders have to work together to turn these ideas into reality. It needs to be something everyone not only believes in but lives out every day. Of course, culture develops organically as well at every level\nbut if you don\u2019t make wellness a priority at the top, it won\u2019t reach the whole globe as effectively. So, what I do is take it to the top and put it on the agenda every chance I get!What are your \u201cTop 5 Trends To Track In the Future of Workplace Wellness?\u201dThrough our partnership with a third-party wellness company, we\u2019ve discovered the top 5 trends our employees care about most and we tracked what our employees had to say about them:Mindfulness/Meditation\n\u201cI was feeling stressed, a lot of anxiety and back/neck pain. I am feeling more relaxed after meditation.\u201d\u201cI feel great and more focused after meditation group.\u201d\u201cI love meditation group I hope to keep it.\u201d\u201cMindful meditation really helped me. I didn\u2019t even know I was clenching my teeth during stressful situations.\u201dVirtual Mental Health:\n\u201cMy one-on-one therapy has been a Godsend for getting through my personal life.\u201d\u201cThe therapy is a great service and I think everyone should seek out an individual session at least once even if it\u2019s something they feel is personal. My past individual sessions were all wonderful and did help me recognize behaviors\nin myself and others.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been able to release stress or emotions built up from my shift during my therapy sessions.\u201d\u201cBeing able to get therapy while going through stuff personally has helped so I can perform my work better.\u201dStress Management/Resilience\n\u201cIn every case of my experiencing negative emotions from extreme content while moderating I have been able to have those negative emotions/stress completely erased. Having access to an educated expert has been immensely more helpful\nfor me than simply talking to a friend, laymen like family and friends that aren\u2019t educated in this field just do not provide the same level of help.\u201d\u201cI really enjoy the variety of things to take our minds off work and learning how to deal with the stress of our job is important too.\u201d\u201cLearning to meditate and relax when stressed or overwhelmed is great.\u201dFinancial Health\n\u201cWe go over multiple subjects even personal subjects to help with schedules and finances all of my sessions are informative and very much appreciated.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve learned new ways to eat healthy, and ways to save money\u201dWeight Loss (nutrition/physical health)\n\u201cMy client has lost 22 pounds in 5 months! We weren\u2019t working on losing weight, just increasing physical activity and stress management. They went to the doctor recently and learned about their weight loss.\u201d\u201cI had a client that lost 15 pounds in the past few weeks; working on their relationship with food.\u201dWellness Coach reported, \u201cI had a client lose 3 pounds in one week after our first visit after the scale not moving for her since January. She just upped her protein intake (vegan) and started drinking more water.\u201d\u201cA client of mine was able to lose 5lbs in the past 2 weeks by decreasing fast food and including more fruits and vegetables.\u201dWellness Coach reported: \u201cClient used to only eat one huge meal a day and would snack on Hot Cheetos throughout the day going through a \u201chuge bag every 2 days or so\u201d. She was \u201ctired all the time and had no energy and\nalways felt bloated after meals\u201d, 6 weeks later she is having 3 meals a day every workday, eating fruits and high protein snacks instead of chips, drinking more water, AND she has hunger cues again! Reports she has higher energy\nthat lasts all day, is able to work out 30 minutes a day, 3 days a week, shirts and pants are fitting her better and doesn\u2019t feel as bloated! We also talked a lot about \u201cnon-scale wins\u201d to avoid being discouraged by numbers\nand she shared this today: \u201ceven if I don\u2019t hit my exact weight loss goal in 3 months, I will still feel so accomplished and proud of my progress and I know as long as I stick with what I\u2019ve been doing I will see results\u201dWhat is your greatest source of optimism about the future of workplace wellness?Humanity. It\u2019s all about the people. And it\u2019s our people who teach us every day what\u2019s the best way to support them. The more I listen to our people, the more hopeful and excited I become.Our readers often like to continue the conversation with our featured interviewees.

Authored by Linda Pophal | Journalist\nChatbots hold a lot of potential for connecting with customers in cost-effective ways, triaging customer requests or inquiries, addressing customer service issues, and more. Jamie Kennedy, director of digital strategy and customer experience solutions at HGS (a global leader in digital user experience solutions), says, \u201cChatbot marketing can be used to automate customer communication for basic or complex digital marketing strategies. Using bots to help market a business is efficient and offers excellent opportunities to optimize and streamline the first point of connection with a customer.\u201d There are some very practical applications for chatbots across all industries. \u201cSimple chatbot marketing strategies may focus on customer service requests and FAQs, and then develop into lead generation and sales moments,\u201d Kennedy says. \u201cThere are also in-app shopping experiences, which are a great way to leverage a seamless chatbot integration. Overall, chatbot integration can add value to digital marketing strategies by increasing website engagement and strengthening a brand\u2019s relationship with its target audiences.\u201d Chatbots also save staff time, which can result in increased productivity and reduced operations costs.\nCHATBOTS PAY OFF\nMike Clifton, EVP and chief information and digital officer at Alorica (a digital customer experience solution), shares an example from one of Alorica\u2019s clients that leveraged Alorica\u2019s Virtual Assistant (AVA), a cognitive chatbot that can handle multiple inquiry types to help customers get answers to even very complex questions. One consumer electronics manufacturer, Clifton says, \u201cwas able to achieve real-world results, as the chatbots were able to reduce customer service costs by 83%, thanks in large part to chatbot conversations resolving over two-thirds\u201467%\u2014of customer inquiries.\u201d Forward-thinking businesses, says Clifton, are successfully employing chatbots to automate high-frequency, low-complexity to mid-complexity interactions at scale with their respective audiences. To do this effectively, he says, \u201ccompanies need to first develop a solid knowledge management foundation to derive the highest probability of responses.\u201d From there, \u201cthey can either deliver those responses to aid in shorter call or chat times or leverage natural language processing to allow virtual assistants to further refine interactions.\u201d Doing this, Clifton says, can help companies improve service while lowering costs and \u201cenjoying increased customer retention, loyalty, and spend.\u201d Because chatbots can add measurable value, it\u2019s important to quantify, track, and manage that value. \u201cChatbots offer unique and novel ways to connect with customers and when done well, [they] can greatly increase customer data performance indicators\u2014 an important, if not the most important, way to measure chatbot success,\u201d says Kennedy.\nSubscribe to Information Today to read the full article."}

Authored by Colson Hillier | Alorica CMO\nThe Metaverse\u2014the next evolution of the web and social media platforms\u2014is poised to dominate the way the world interacts. There is transformational potential to change how people communicate, connect and engage with media, brands and each other, akin to the impact of the smartphone. While still an emerging technology, the Metaverse is beginning to have real-world impact, particularly in the areas of training, gaming, and eCommerce. Although the Metaverse\u2019s influence\u2014and its potential growth\u2014remains unknown for now, savvy brands are beginning to explore what it means to their customers.\nThe Metaverse is a new realm for brands to interact with customers; and with it, a new way for customers to be supported by the companies they\u2019ve come to count on in the real world. The rules of engagement may be more dynamic, but the need for outstanding customer experiences (CX) remains constant. Brands face both the opportunity and the challenge to design and build experiences in a new medium, which remove the constraints of traditional service models.\nThe interest of specialized digital CX services is expanding, as brands find themselves increasingly needing more sophisticated digital solutions, trained CX professionals and multilingual support. Focusing on use cases that bridge the constraints of today\u2019s service models to the boundaryless augmented and virtual realities is an opportunity for leadership. As the flywheel of content creation, hardware adoption and consumer adoption grow, having a flexible workforce at scale, ready to be deployed to meet customer expectations in a new dimension is critical.\nWinning in the Brave New (Virtual) World\nAlorica, a Gartner Magic Quadrant leader among customer service BPOs, has been at the forefront of the digital CX transformation, helping global brands engage customers\u2014over 2 billion interactions a year\u2014for the past 20+ years. We\u2019ve developed a few best practices for brands contemplating their place in the Metaverse, based on decades of digital CX leadership and automation technology expertise, including online gaming and streaming service support.\nDon\u2019t call it a trend. The Metaverse is already generating billions of dollars in revenue,\u00a0according to JP Morgan, and continues to grow. Most people realize why after the first time they experience virtual reality (VR). While the adoption curve can be debated, the utility and opportunity cannot. Early use cases in training, gaming, travel and media are taking hold. Companies should think more about when, not if their customers will seek out experiences in the Metaverse.\nMeet consumers where they (virtually) are. Build anchor content and experiences that are tailored to early adopters; they expect digital solutions, immediacy, personalization and reward brands that deliver. Like any new technology, we can\u2019t forget the human backstop \u2013 offer agent support, live chat, content moderation, expert reviews that are authentic and digital-first CX, which are critical to driving adoption and repeat users.\nInvest in the right technologies\u2014and technology partners. With many transactions still virtual only\u2014mainly within contained online gaming platforms\u2014familiarity with massive multiplayer online (MMO) games, as well as Trust & Safety best practices, including fraud prevention and content moderation, is important. AI and machine learning are also key in this sphere, empowering automations to enhance the customer experience at multiple touchpoints. Investing in AI and machine learning are foundational to both real-world and virtual transactions, but few CX providers can offer this type of learning expertise alongside seasoned customer care support.\nAcquaint agents fully with the Metaverse customer journey. Customers are already transacting in the Multiverse and expect agents to know how to help them. To provide stellar support, agents need more than just routine training. They need to be immersed in the current incarnation of the Metaverse\u2014including VR and online gaming, using digital currencies, buying, and selling NFTs and virtual-to-physical transactions\u2014to ensure Metaverse-based CX is consistently\u2026insanely great.\nAs the Metaverse expands, companies can find their footing and establish themselves effectively and sustainably. It\u2019s all about having the right approach and the right digital CX partnerships to move them forward, one virtual\u2014or virtual-to-physical\u2014transaction at a time.\nAnd Alorica\u2019s at the forefront of it all, tailoring new\u00a0Outcomes as a Service (OaaS)\u00a0paradigms to power insanely great CX online and offline, maximizing opportunities for brands and the customers who love them anywhere and everywhere.\nRead the full article at https://bit.ly/3p4CUdw."}

Authored by Katie Kuehner-Hebert | Journalist\nWhat does it take to be a successful CFO? For one, intellectual curiosity\u2014delving beyond the \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d to also understand the \u201cwhy,\u201d to better integrate the financials into the broader picture.\nSo says Max Schwendner, CFO of Irvine, California-based Alorica, a customer services BPO company. Schwendner spoke with StrategicCFO360 about the insights he\u2019s learned on his non-traditional journey to the top finance seat: prior to joining Alorica, he spent more than a decade on Wall Street, primarily at J.P. Morgan. During that time, he held leadership roles in the investment bank and private equity divisions of the company serving as portfolio manager, vice president in corporate finance/M&A; chief of staff to the CEO of investment banking; and various other positions.\nAdditionally, Schwendner has served in leadership positions on several portfolio company board of directors, was chairman of several limited partnership committees and co-founded a small film production company.\nWhat are some proven strategies and techniques that financial professionals can leverage to best elevate themselves from customary financial management roles, such as portfolio and wealth managers, to the CFO level?\nThroughout my career, I\u2019ve been very fortunate to work with many top-tier, insightful executives and I\u2019ve learned valuable lessons from each one of them. In particular, during my tenure at J.P. Morgan, I had several mentors who were incredibly intelligent, insightful and curious people and I\u2019ve sought to emulate each of their best qualities in how I operate today.\nOne of the most important aspects I\u2019ve learned through my career is the importance of maintaining a sense of intellectual curiosity\u2014asking smart questions to understand not only the \u201cwhat\u201d and the \u201chow,\u201d but also the \u201cwhy.\u201d From my chair, the best leaders\u2014financial or otherwise\u2014are ones not limited by role and responsibility, but those who try to think broadly and integrate the financials into the broader picture. Oftentimes, there is a far greater story to uncover and tell than just pure dollars and cents.\nTaking a non-traditional path to the CFO seat is rare, but if you have an aptitude for finance, you can create your own definition of the role. What I mean is that I\u2019m not defined solely by my ability to put together financial statements. Rather, I view myself as a partner to the business, which involves taking a more consultative approach to managing a corporation\u2019s financial health rather than just focusing on an individual financial metric. One parting thought: don\u2019t be afraid to be yourself, show your personality! It dispels the stereotypes often associated with accounting and finance professionals.\nIn consideration of the importance and responsibilities of today\u2019s modern CFO, what are the critical skills and capabilities one needs to be successful as a C-Suite financial management executive? How and why are these so essential to the position?\nThe hard skills are just table stakes\u2014every finance professional has those. The soft skills are really what separates a great CFO from a good one. CFOs are expected to have the answers to difficult financial questions; that\u2019s a given. The finesse and real skill lie in answering the \u201cwhy,\u201d which requires a deep understanding of the entire business so one can offer simple explanations with proper context. A CFO needs to be able to provide a view of the business at 100, 1,000 and 10,000 feet\u2014and explaining things simply while not being pedantic.\nWhat are the primary differences from being a CFO at a product-driven company from those of a services provider such as Alorica?\nFrom a financial perspective, there are not too many differences between a product-driven company and a services provider. Dollars and cents are dollars and cents. Revenue is revenue, and expenses are expenses. However, a service-oriented business is more complex to manage in some sense because it\u2019s driven by people, which means there\u2019s variability. Solving for personal dynamics is challenging because it\u2019s inherently personal.\nWith so many companies being service providers these days, what proactive stances should CFOs at these companies take to ensure the long-term financial vitality and sustainability of their respective organizations?\nEvery CFO\u2019s job is to mind the store: spend money on the right things, not the wrong ones. I try to focus the company on a simple goal\u2014save as much money as possible on non-strategic, simple things so that money can fund solid investments in things that will advance, propel and improve the business.\nMy philosophy is pragmatic and my approach is to understand the larger picture within which a decision is being made. So contextualizing what an investment, decision or action will drive is essential. It\u2019s that knowledge and insight that informs these decisions because many of these moves are intended to enhance operating efficiency, employee productivity, the product/solutions portfolio\u2014now and into the future.\nRead the full article at https://bit.ly/3QDIYW2"}

Authored by Katie Kuehner-Hebert | Writer\u202f\u00a0Mike Clifton, Chief Information and Digital Officer at Alorica, says today\u2019s CIOs need to be able to sell technology internally and externally: \u201cIt\u2019s as much a part of the job as it is to ensure that the IT infrastructure you have\nin place is operating well.\u201d\u00a0What does a modern CIO look like? Mike Clifton, whose very title\u2014a combination of chief information and digital officer at Irvine, California-based customer experience provider Alorica\u2014argues the position has changed.\u00a0Today, information chiefs need to be able to rally the company around a tech-assisted vision, and help clients understand what the company is capable of. Clifton spoke with StrategicCIO360 about how to stay current, why companies are like puzzles\nand why IT can no longer be isolated from the rest of the business.\u00a0\u00a0The CIO role is often a misunderstood one. Considering how the position has evolved over the past three decades, how would you clearly and succinctly describe the position and responsibilities of today\u2019s modern CIO? How have these dynamics changed in recent years? What are\u2014or should be\u2014a CIO\u2019s primary area of focus now?\u00a0Today, the market demands facing our businesses are more complex than in prior years. The ways in which businesses sell, service and deliver are now integrated into multi-channel, customer-centric outcomes. The transforming CIO role is focused more\non orchestrating the art of the possible within the defined technical stack. But the future of this role will center around bridging what could be if investments into digital platforms were well coordinated.\u00a0In my combined role as chief information and digital officer, I develop, strategize and deliver next-gen solutions to support these outcomes. Building the technology ecosystem to drive data strategy and ensuring the right products are operationally\ncost effective and efficiently configured is critical to accelerating our digital offerings and enabling a go-to-market strategy.\u00a0\u00a0We all know information technology is constantly changing. What strategies should CIOs adopt to stay abreast of current IT advancements and innovations? What are the best ways to objectively assess the relevancy of these developments to one\u2019s own organization?\u00a0There really isn\u2019t one single method to stay current. In my experience, the highest value has come from spending time with business stakeholders to understand client trends and map market investments or platform capabilities to advance our portfolio.\nI recommend thinking of your company as a puzzle with pieces that connect to provide solutions for your customers. It\u2019s crucial to have an internal capability to capture innovation that aligns bottom-up needs, which then transforms into\nkey areas for investigating technical capabilities.\u00a0\u00a0What are the most important skills and capabilities that today\u2019s CIO needs to be as successful? How and why are these so essential to the position? How did you acquire them during your career arc?\u00a0No single leader or department can achieve optimal results alone. To deliver outcomes efficiently and at scale, teams need to work collaboratively; various stakeholders bring different viewpoints that help solve for a need most effectively. I learned\nthis through listening to each of the leaders for perspective and encouraging them to take risk and accountability. The difference in taking planned risks and reinforcing that it\u2019s ok to fail but learn from it and take the next opportunity\nis showing that learning applied.\u00a0Being able to sell the potential of new technologies is key. It\u2019s about distilling the highly technical aspects into a compelling story about solutions that deliver outcomes. In my current role as chief digital officer (in addition to CIO) and\nin my prior executive IT positions, you have to sell internally/externally\u2014it\u2019s as much a part of the job as it is to ensure that the IT infrastructure you have in place is operating well.\u00a0Ensure your team sees firsthand your ability to influence and drive strategy. That allows them to better understand the role the team plays, and it empowers them to do the same with stakeholders. Leadership may be an innate quality but it\u2019s\nalso a skill you continue to hone through time and practice. Throughout my career, I\u2019ve just continued to stay engaged with the business, my teams and clients both internal and external. The better I know the pulse of my stakeholders, the\nbetter I can lead.\u00a0Make the connection between technology and enabling business outcomes, offering optionality to cost and outcomes. I was able to do this by earning a seat at the table early on, allowing me to better understand and interpret future needs, which then\nled to coming up with the digital solutions that fit.\u00a0\u00a0Many CIOs are constantly wringing their hands and losing sleep at night over cybersecurity concerns, which can cripple a corporation. What steps are you and your team taking to improve your company\u2019s IT security protocols and comprehensively safeguard corporate data?\u00a0At Alorica, we handle more than two billion customer interactions a year on behalf of some of the most well-known brands in the world. As such, data security is a top priority. Part of our proactive and comprehensive strategy includes collaborating\nwith third-party experts in all domains, constantly testing our technologies and consistently educating our people at every level. We also continue to operationally mature processes to keep pace with the rapid changes occurring daily in this environment.\u00a0\u00a0Read the full article at: https://bit.ly/3S4UxpD"}

Authored by Loren Moss | Founder and PublisherUS based customer experience outsourcing firm  Alorica\u00a0chose Cali as the keystone city for its expansion into Colombia. So far, the company is satisfied it made the correct decision, as it continues growth in the Andean country. Colombia is one of the newest out of the 18 countries where Alorica operates, serving customer contact across over 250 clients in 30 languages from its 100,000 employees.Alorica currently has approximately 350 employees in its first Cali, Colombia center, with a capacity to grow to 600 seats. The site is located in a large retail shopping mall, providing employees options for transport, dining, and entertainment. From the site, Alorica services financial, retail and healthcare accounts.A year after the official opening, Alorica invited Finance Colombia in for a visit and tour of the facilities. Executive Editor Loren Moss spoke with Alorica team members including Talent Acquisition Manager Camila Rivas, Site Director Tulio Padilla, and Operations Manager Andr\u00e9s Molina.\u00a0Finance Colombia: Colombia is very competitive when it comes to BPO and contact centers, but it is curious that although Cali is doing very well, it is not as well-known as Bogot\u00e1 and Medell\u00edn. What is the special touch that Cali offers to the sector?Tulio Padilla: I think there are two types of advantages. The first is about our bilingual workforce and that is that in Cali, there are many programs that support the growth of bilingualism. That is not so common in cities like Bogot\u00e1 and Medellin. In reality, I would say that Bogot\u00e1 and Medell\u00edn are cities that are a little, or much more touristy than Cali, and the bilingual workforce that we have in Cali is much more local.Likewise, Cali has fairly strong internet penetration. It is the third best city in the country for internet service, which of course helps us a lot with the stability of our network and the stability required to provide services to our customers. In addition, Cali\u2019s location is strategic. This is a city with direct flights to many cities in the United States which obviously facilitates visits both by our clients and also by the different Alorica staff and let\u2019s say that the weather and the altitude also helps a lot so that there are not so many local risks such as earthquakes, risks of tidal waves allowing us to have a much greater stability than in other cities in the country.\u00a0Finance Colombia: Right. I would like to ask you, speaking of manpower, how are you recruiting talent here? How difficult is it to find and hire bilingual talent?Maria Camila Rivas: Yes. It is quite a big challenge. Because first, this industry is not known in the city and in the department. So, the first thing we did when we landed in the city was to make ourselves known as a real job option for young people and for anyone who wanted to look for work in Cali and in the surrounding cities or municipalities.At the beginning, we had to educate the population, telling them what a call center is, what a BPO is, what our industry is as well as the options we offer. Once our brand was positioned, then we started looking for bilingual talent.Let\u2019s say with Andres, that is precisely why he is with us in this interview. He was the first to start the operation here. He was the first to start receiving that bilingual talent\u2026So, it was also a learning curve between us as a recruitment department and his perspective from an operational standpoint, to search and find that balance that would allow us to identify those people. So, little by little, we found those niches, that pool of candidates that we required or that we needed because of their English level, and they brought their friends, their acquaintances, and so little by little, we filled the site. As you can see, we already have three different customers and in conjunction with the Pacific projects, anything related to the bilingualism programs, we get there. To introduce ourselves as a company, foster alliances with English institutes, everything that represents English, we are there.\u00a0Finance Colombia: Alorica is recognized worldwide as a very important global call center brand, however this was the first working site for you in Colombia. Was it difficult to establish a brand? Because those who work in call centers in the industry such as those who follow the industry know very well who Alorica is but getting here and hiring people is a different thing. How did you handle the challenge, to establish the brand not so much as a service provider but as an employer?Mar\u00eda Camila Rivas: So, we had, let\u2019s say, two channels: the first, social networks. From the beginning, we had a community manager, who is still working with us, and she was in charge of taking all the culture we had at the regional level and landing it here in Colombia. So, we also started working with a local marketing agency to add the \u201cCale\u00f1o\u201d seal on it, so we said how everything was Cale\u00f1o, ca\u00f1elizate, Alorica Cale\u00f1o accent, everything, so that people would start asking how is it? What is this?Well then, at least out of curiosity, we began to reach out to young people. We started with Instagram, Facebook, so the good thing is that from the beginning we always had the building, so that would allow us to show candidates and potential candidates that this was real, that it was not something that we are showing today but that tomorrow it would not exist. We have an excellent location, we are located in Palmetto where most people know that it is a shopping center, it is not a building from nowhere, so let\u2019s say that little by little, we had the guarantee to make ourselves known in the city.In addition to that, as I was saying that we participated in other events with our brand, explaining to people who we are, what the opportunities are, and so on, I think it was a mix of many things: Our social networks, the marketing agency, our participation in events. Our goal was to be everywhere. We even had billboard cars moving around the city talking about Alorica, everything you can think of, we did it. Here we are!\u00a0Finance Colombia: What you do as an employer to promote individualism so that a person feels like: \u201cWhen I go to work there is no need to hide who I am?\"Andres Molina: I think that one of the most important things for that, and that has happened here since we opened, has been the open-door policy. I think that is key. The fact that anyone is able to establish open communication with each other regardless of their position. That allows us all to be ourselves and to be able to show who we are without fear, without fear of discrimination, without fear of retaliation of any kind. That has been something that since we launched, I think that all operations to date and, in all support, and administrative areas have been maintained. The fact that we all can talk without any problem\u2014and also activities that are done within the site depending on the time of year.We do different activities that allow people to show what they are good at. So, apart from the environment of only answering calls and only coming to work, they really show who they are. Let me give you an example; last month we had an activity in which everyone was very participative and very involved. And then those kinds of things, those kinds of activities and additionally, the support that is felt from each and every one from the areas is essential for that.\u00a0Finance Colombia: What are the opportunities to advance as a person starting from an entry level. Are there opportunities to grow? Tell me how that worksAndres Molina: There are, and I think it is one of the great advantages of being a new site. Let me tell you, for instance, from the program that I manage, in the year that we have been operating, we have promoted around fourteen, fifteen people between supervisors, trainers, even towards other areas such as talent acquisition and I think it is very important. And I think it is something that also people, when they began to know us and when they began to work here, they notice that they were real opportunities.The fact of obtaining the projection of growth is not only in the individual programs but also as a site opens up these opportunities a lot. We focus a lot on getting to know the people we work with, knowing where they want to grow and what moves them in order to start developing and starting to create that BPO and call center culture that it is not only to stay answering calls all your life but to grow. There are opportunities to work in operations, training, quality support areas also have their own opportunities. So, it is one of the great advantages that we have as a new site to be able to show people and being able to show everyone who has come here that everyone, because I believe that almost everyone at this time, all the staff within each of the operations was promoted internally.\u00a0Finance Colombia: What would you say is the difference between Alorica and others, given that you are competing for talent with other employers inside and outside the sector. What is it that you do, not only from the employee standpoint but also from the customer standpoint? why choose Alorica instead of any other company?Tulio Padilla: I think there are many points, really. I have had the opportunity to work in different BPOs and I have never come across an organizational structure as strong and as good as the one that Alorica has. I think we have a very big advantage, and it is, first, in the BPO industry, each country works very individually, very apart.Here, I think we have a great advantage, and that is that we have 23 years of combined experience from people who have helped us, guided us to have a very successful project without taking away the opportunity to customize Alorica to our culture and to bring our culture to the company, and that Alorica really opens the doors to understand the Cali culture as well as the Colombian culture in general, that would be something important for me.Andres Molina: Yes. In addition, I believe that the work environment that we have been able to generate within the company and that, within that same environment that same communication that we have been able to generate internally; I really believe that we have been able to show our teammates that there is a real balance between work and life. I think that has been quite important to all of us here. We really care about the people we work with, and we really care to make sure that they feel good at work as well in their personal life. Those have been key factors. I think that the entire leadership team is focused on showing that the balance can be real if we can achieve it as long as there is some communication\u2026But I do believe that the working environment is and has been super important.Maria Camila Rivas: I am on the same page there! For example, I have known Andres for, I would say, eight years now. We had the chance to work together in Bogot\u00e1 for another very large BPO company and the two of us arrived here. I invited him to join this project believing that having the chance to start from scratch and having the opportunity to open a site gives you the chance to leave your mark. Andres is in fact from Barranquilla. He worked in Bogot\u00e1; we brought him from there to here.For example, in Tulio\u2019s case, as I was telling you, the fact that he had already lived here, went back to Bogot\u00e1 and has decided to come back here, clearly means that he understands the potential. We have been in this industry for about ten years, knowing different BPOs and what Tulio and Andres just mentioned, our work environment and how we work together, I think that is what has helped us.We always go to a place together. For instance, eight days ago, we were celebrating our anniversary, everyone from all lines of business, all departments supporting, so I think that is what really stands out. Even candidates perceive it. When they get here, they sit in the lobby waiting to be interviewed. And when they see people walking by, they realize that people are happy here. They say that there are no other places where people smile that much! That is why I love that they smile because that is our agents\u2019 expression and the expression of most of the people who work here. There might be times when they are not smiling, maybe they want to have lunch, but in general they are happy, so that is what it does, because we too, from the different areas and departments, whatever the role in the hierarchy, we want people to feel good. That is precisely what we do here in Alorica.\u00a0Read the full article at:\u00a0https://bit.ly/3Uz1mBB"}

Authored by Bob Violino | WriterAnyone who depends on LinkedIn to search for jobs, find business partners or other opportunities is probably aware that the business social media site has had issues with fake profiles. While that is no different than other social media platforms including\nTwitter and Facebook, it presents a different set of problems for users who look to use LinkedIn for professional purposes.Between January 1 and June 30, more than 21 million fake accounts were detected and removed from LinkedIn,\u00a0according to the company\u2019s community report.\nWhile 95.3% of those fake accounts were stopped at registration by automated defenses, according to the company, there was a nearly 28% increase in fake accounts caught compared to the previous six-month period.

Authored by Shawn Stacy | Chief Client Officer at\u00a0AloricaThe value of the booming subscription economy is\u00a0expected\u00a0to hit $275 billion globally by the end of the year. Subscription-based business models are taking off in large part because of their recurring revenue, providing brands with ongoing cash flow and creating better visibility into future earnings. But another key advantage is the opportunity to increase the lifetime value of customer relationships by driving upsell or cross-sell opportunities.What brands need to do to maximize the value of subscriptions is deliver\u2014and differentiate themselves\u2014on exceptional customer experiences (CX). This includes real-time support and service to meet high demand while furthering customer relationships.Here\u2019s how brands can connect more deeply with their customers and empower customers to get the most from their subscriptions.Focus on retention tactics that further engage subscribersDon\u2019t take the \u201cguaranteed\u201d revenue stream for granted by failing to innovate and offer more compelling value propositions. Successful brands recognize that subscriptions only work if the entire journey is orchestrated, from the types of products offered each month to all the communications and interactions that occur in between.Oftentimes, companies focus more on prevention (tactics to not lose subscribers) rather than retention (tactics to further engage subscribers). Although the two ideas are similar, the latter centers on being easily accessible and visible to consumers, giving them solid reasons to stay with a brand and potentially buy more. To accomplish this, companies need to unlock omnichannel functionality\u2014activating text, email, social, and voice all at once\u2014to create various avenues for customers to connect in real time.They should also proactively reach out to customers to measure their ongoing satisfaction\u2014a perfect chance to promote other service offerings. Customer outreach efforts can also help generate better CX.\u00a0A deeper understanding of what customers want can result in more personalized recommendations, easier sign-up processes, and customer-driven investments to improve overall ROI.Deliver products AND customer lifetime valueWinning customers over through retention tactics requires brands to implement a proactive CX strategy, one that not only engages audiences on their favorite channels but also tailors each and every interaction based on the individual customer. If a company\u2019s touchpoints are limited to the routine shipping and receipt of each monthly subscription, then they are missing out on critical data points that provide insights into customer behavior and preferences. The intent is to gain your customers\u2019 trust and confidence in your brand by understanding their needs and ensuring your products deliver on the demand. Focus on customer life cycles that not only reach multiple years but also grow as time goes on by getting to know them.The significance of customer life cycles bears out in advanced metrics, including the increasingly important lifetime value formula, which defines subscription-based industries. The rise of the software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model upended the existing B2C and B2B paradigms, with new software companies and 80% of existing vendors offering subscription services.\u00a0Meanwhile, video games account for 39% of subscription revenue, making LTV more critical than other metrics.To maximize customer LTV in today\u2019s \u201ceverything as a service\u201d economy, companies can\u2019t just view their consumers as monoliths; each customer must be understood at the individual level, including their wants and needs, aspirations and frustrations.\u00a0Understanding LTV is essential for organizations to thrive in our forever-wired world.Harness data to drive continuous improvement and customizationTo develop a deeper, long-term relationship, continue to adapt CX strategies, processes and offerings. Subscription-based businesses cannot personalize experiences through sheer intuition or a vague profile of their median customer. Equipped with data-driven insights, companies can make more informed decisions about what consumers want and need.In the video game market, new device technology is adopted quickly, so data that breaks down what gamers are using (game controllers, VR headsets) helps companies fine-tune support efforts to consistently meet players\u2019 expectations.For businesses that are hoping to grow, they need to invest in customer service and marketing technology solutions as a general rule so that subscribers are constantly invited to engage through a feedback loop that is monitored and measured. With the right CX strategy in place, brands can begin to collect and collate data from these interactions to further personalize the next engagement.Invest in converting your subscribers into brand evangelistsBuild brand advocacy within your existing stakeholder community. Many companies recruit influencers to promote their offerings instead of focusing on their own customers and CX support associates, who are more believable and knowledgeable in validating their brand.If you\u2019re looking to expand your subscription-based business, invest in CX professionals who can resolve issues in real time and serve as brand ambassadors. This will create loyalists out of customers through each interaction and beyond.\u00a0Shawn Stacy is Chief Client Officer at\u00a0Alorica.\u00a0Read the full article."}

Authored by Colson Hillier | Chief Marketing Officer at Alorica\nThe hype cycle is in full effect, as the metaverse and a network of virtual worlds continues to grow. The immersive experiences that are enabled through the metaverse are truly groundbreaking and could unlock infinite possibilities for customer engagement. Though it\u2019s one of the most compelling tech shifts drawing attention, realizing the promise of the metaverse could depend on applying key lessons that CX leaders have taken from prior generations of digital channel adoption.\nIn the early 2010s, for example, digital channels such as email, social media and SMS text were still under-leveraged, and brands with omnichannel functionality were at the vanguard. Then, as the network effect accelerated and consumption shifted to digital, consumers not only demanded choice in channels but also expected seamless brand interactions across these channels. This ushered in new platforms for customer relationship management, cloud delivery, APIs and interoperability between technologies. I believe the winners during this period maintained high-engagement service and delivery models by elegantly blending the ease and immediacy of digital channels with the problem-solving and empathy that skilled service agents deliver. Experiences in the metaverse should elevate and extend existing service experiences as a bridge to creating a new model for interactions.\nBeyond the technology capabilities, consumer adoption of the metaverse depends on the flywheel effect; platform providers should create transformational content to attract new customers and increase active users. The challenge is that many early activations are likely to lack access to support, be difficult to navigate or, even worse, expose users to negative experiences such as harassment. As platform providers determine how to solve the challenges of creating safe and interoperable brand environments, brands will be in a better position to create customer experiences that transcend established CX models. I think there will be a day when most consumers will have a presence in the metaverse, so companies should consider three key things to prepare to meet them where they\u2019re at in this virtual world.\nOrchestrate The User Experience\nWhat could initially entice customers to engage with companies in the metaverse is the opportunity to have a more in-depth, extended experience with brands and their products\u2014such as being able to see firsthand how an appliance works, sitting in a new car or virtually touring a home for sale. With the current iteration of the metaverse largely promoting self-curation, users are building the world around them and driving their own experiences, including these extended brand interactions. It leaves much to the imagination, including all the various tech and content issues an IT or customer care professional could envision. Due to the learning curve of this new interaction model and the virtual nature of the metaverse, many users could struggle to understand how to navigate these new worlds. Consumers will inevitably encounter barriers that will prevent them from enjoying the full experience, including not only making transactions but also missing other important customer touchpoints, such as interactive games, digital prizes and product demonstrations.\nTo ensure brands are equipped to support their audiences in the metaverse, they should ensure their customer service associates are immersed in these worlds and the currencies that fuel them. The truth is that many companies do not have the resources or the historical context to adequately educate and train their customer service teams for success in this new realm. That\u2019s why companies will need to leverage the CX expertise they built in the traditional world but also quickly get their teams familiar with and well versed in this new enterprise.\nMinimize Risks To Maximize The Metaverse\u2019s Potential\nBecause the metaverse is largely decentralized, each world is governed by its own set of rules and policies that is designed to protect against misbehavior ranging from mild nuisances to full-fledged fraud and abuse. Metaverse platforms may have tools to automatically weed out user misbehavior, but these may not be 100% effective. It will ultimately fall on companies to ensure the branded experiences they offer are safe and secure.\nTo fully insulate themselves from these risks, brands can build out their CX teams so that they have customer care professionals on hand to moderate behavior and content that encroaches on the branded experiences. At a minimum, brands setting up shop in the metaverse should ensure their content moderators and agents are available via live chat\u00a0to help deal with any potential breaches in real time. Whether customer service agents are directly controlling avatars in the metaverse or streamlining support issues confined to the platforms themselves (or other third parties behind the scenes), CX professionals who are familiar with these worlds and experienced in navigating trust and safety issues will be beneficial.\nTest, Learn And Test Again\nWe continue to learn from customer service interactions, which are becoming one of the key data sources for the world\u2019s largest brands. Agents do not just resolve issues but also serve as brand ambassadors who engage with customers by recommending products or services and collecting crucial information about the customer\u2019s journey.\nIn a new medium, no one gets it perfect out of the gate. The goal is to ensure you\u2019re listening to and engaging with customers to capture the impact of user activations. You can accomplish this in a number of ways, including by gamifying experiences for customers. This can help you increase engagement while also yielding direct feedback on sentiment and past experiences. Connecting customer profiles so that they bridge both online and offline activities can help you to build personalized experiences that are tailored to the individual customer and feel like a natural extension of your brand engagement.\nGet Ready\nThere is little doubt in my mind that the metaverse will soon become pervasive. If adoption becomes increasingly widespread, consumers will expect the brands they love to create experiences that are engaging, personalized and memorable, while also ensuring safety and security. Companies that understand the inherent complexities and are well equipped to respond accordingly will be poised to win.\nRead the original article at https://bit.ly/3ke0ANe."}

Authored by Bob Violino | WriterData is what drives digital business. Consider how strategically important it has become for companies to leverage advanced analytics to uncover trends that can help them gain decisive insights they might not otherwise possess.\nBut data-driven projects are not always easy to launch, let alone complete. In fact, enterprises face several challenges as they look to leverage their information resources to gain a competitive advantage.\u00a0Foundry\u2019s recent\nData & Analytics Study\u00a0looked into why organizations have difficulty making good on the promise of data-driven projects and revealed several key roadblocks to success. Here are the top six reasons\ndata initiatives fail to materialize and deliver, as revealed by the research, along with tips from IT leaders and data experts on how to overcome them.\u00a0\u00a01. Lack of funding for data initiativesFunding can be hard to come by for any technology initiatives, particularly in an uncertain economy. This certainly applies to data projects. These undertakings might be competing with a host of other initiatives in need of financing, so it\u2019s important\nfor IT leaders and their data teams to present a strong business case for each project, and to not make them overly complex.\u00a02. Lack of a clearly articulated data strategyOftentimes there isn\u2019t a clear understanding within enterprises of what data is available, how the data is defined, how frequently it changes, and how it is being used, says Mike Clifton, executive vice president and chief information and digital\nofficer at Alorica, a global customer service outsourcing firm.Companies need to create a common language among stakeholders in advance of establishing any data-driven projects, Clifton says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a solid foundation, budget and funding are too unpredictable and often get cut first due to\na lack of clear scope and achievable outcome,\u201d he says.\u00a03. Technology to implement data projects is too costlyMaking the challenge of getting sufficient funding for data projects even more daunting is the fact that they can be expensive endeavors. Data-driven projects require a substantial investment of resources and budget from inception, Clifton says.\u201cThey are generally long-term projects that can\u2019t be applied as a quick fix to address urgent priorities,\u201d Clifton says. \u201cMany decision makers don\u2019t fully understand how they work or deliver for the business. The complex\nnature of gathering data to use it efficiently to deliver clear [return on investment] is often intimidating to businesses because one mistake can exponentially drive costs.\u201dWhen done correctly, however, these projects\ncan\nstreamline and save the organization time and money\nover the long haul, Clifton says. \u201cThat\u2019s why it is essential to have a clear strategy for maximizing data and then ensuring that key stakeholders understand the plan and execution,\u201d he says.\nIn addition to investing in the tools needed to support data-driven projects, organizations need to\u202frecruit and retain professionals such as data scientists. These in-demand positions typically command high levels of compensation.\u00a0\u00a04. Other digital transformation initiatives took priorityDigital transformations are under way at organizations in virtually every industry, and it\u2019s easy to see how projects related to these efforts could be given a high priority. That doesn\u2019t mean data-driven projects should be put on the back\nburner.\u00a05. Lack of executive buy-in or advocacy for data initiativesIf senior executives are not sold on data-driven projects, their chance of success will likely diminish because of lack of adequate funding and resources.To\u202fget executive buy-in, technology leaders must be able to articulate from the beginning what the outcomes of data projects will be and align them to business priorities or pain points, Clifton says. Ironically, all digital-related deployments\ndepend heavily on data to achieve benefits, \u201cso whether or not the executives realize it, they are funding data initiatives,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u00a06. Lack of appropriate skill setsThe technology skills shortage is affecting nearly every area of IT, including data-driven projects.Hiring talent with the specific technical experience needed to lead and manage data-driven projects \u201cis a challenge in this competitive job market, but it\u2019s key in ensuring you have the right skills in place to successfully implement\nthe projects,\u201d Clifton says. \u201cWithout the right skills and expertise up front, companies can start a project and then run into issues where the team is unable to quickly and effectively identify and resolve the problem.\u201d\nData\nscientists, data stewards, and data forensics experts are becoming mainstay roles, Clifton says, whereas\u202f data architects\u202fwere\nthe higher-end skills most needed in prior years.\u00a0Read the full article at: https://bit.ly/3YyL4L2"}

Authored by Colson Hillier | Alorica CMOThe customer-centric movement that defined transformative business models over the past decade shows no signs of stopping. Even in a tough economy, most brands remain committed to improving the customer experience (CX) and emphasizing retention. Nevertheless,\nit would be foolish to think that changes won\u2019t have to be made or that resources are unlimited especially in a potential recession. That\u2019s why companies have to stay prepared for the good and hard times, balancing their CX strategy to\nprioritize meeting service expectations while reducing operational costs.Unprecedented labor shortages and geo-political instability have created significant risks that can disrupt operations and brands\u2019 relationships with their customers. To prepare for economic headwinds and maintain resiliency this year, companies\nshould consider the following tactics to recession-proof their business.Adopt A Flexible Workforce ModelOne of the tried and tested methods of making CX delivery more affordable is through geographically diverse delivery. For decades, brands have outsourced critical business functions, including customer support, to other countries for cost efficiency and\nbusiness continuity. This strategy has become much more robust with new technologies, workforce models and geographies that create new opportunities for brands. As budgets are strained, inflation rises and geo-political issues fuel an uncertainty\nin demand, the focus should be on how to shift and augment service-related functions to markets with strong talent pools that offer a balance of improved continuity, reduced cost and flexibility to meet changing market conditions.To do this, brands must design a balanced workforce model that is built on flexibility and redundancy. A workforce model that not only embraces offshoring, but also multi-shoring is a great place to start. That way, if there is unforeseen disruption in\na given market, brands will be able to shift resources to other hubs so that delivery does not have to pause, let alone stop entirely. Second, hybrid workforce models that allow work-at-home delivery is a necessity in the post-COVID environment. A\ndistributed workforce attracts more talent while providing resiliency against points of failure, such as a storm, allowing companies to adapt in the wake of crisis. Finally, including flexible workforce models like gig and part time expand your reach\nfor talent and can support short term spikes to efficiently cover peaks in demand.Bridge the Performance GapFlexible workforce models should be driven in large part by a brand\u2019s north star: the customer. Once brands identify key outcomes expected at each stage of the customer journey, they can begin to focus on an employee experience that meets those\nexpectations throughout the employee lifecycle, using analytics in a way that optimizes CX. Companies can do this by creating an analysis that highlights shortcomings and facilitates a quick response. One of the best ways to do this is to harness\nthe Voice of Employee \u2013 collecting feedback on employee confidence in providing support that aligns to the customer journey. For example, if customer service representatives report a lack of confidence in their training or tools to support a\nnew product launch or they receive customer complaints, it should direct leadership to focus on where support is most needed.Customer service leaders today have a bevy of analytics and tools to evaluate the employee experience. From interaction analytics, which provides advanced customer call insights, to knowledge management, which provides agent response efficacy data, and\nagent assist, which provides next best action insights, brands should deploy focused technologies that support the customer experience using data as their guide to efficient prioritization and deployment.Enable AutomationThe most sure-fire way to stave off financial downturn is to improve operational efficiencies. Beyond external talent and workforce optimization tools, companies can also tap AI-powered solutions that automate elements of CX. Brands can streamline service\nthroughout the customer journey by adopting digital tools that automate functions that are less complex \u2013 leaving their staff to focus on solving customer needs that require empathy and advanced problem solving, such as technical support and\nsales. AI and process automation solutions today can quickly and accurately manage tasks, activities, and processes that have repeatable support requirements, require 24/7 availability and benefit from high accuracy and throughput.One of the greatest innovations that has transformed contact centers in recent years is intelligent routing, where customers are seamlessly connected to the optimal resource to deal with the issue sometimes through a digital flow, or when appropriate,\nwith an agent as a backstop so customers are never left in the cold. Technology like this integrates the power of AI with the delicacy of human intervention. This is vital in modern CX, as customers see contact center associates as brand ambassadors\nand a direct extension of the represented brand. Automation should never be deployed in isolation as efficiency gains will backfire when a customer is lost because they couldn\u2019t reach an empowered resource to resolve their issue.AI tools aren\u2019t just helping CX teams react to support tickets. They also unlock proactive service delivery. Whether that\u2019s account resolution or revenue generation, leading tech solutions available today empower sales activities that tie\ndirectly to profitability. These types of actions include follow-ups regarding an abandoned shopping cart or when engagement with a product is waning. The intended outcome with a proactive model is to captivate customers while giving CX agents the\ntime and the ability to manage the most critical problems. According to\u00a0recent estimates, brands are already eying proactive capabilities,\nas 98 percent of organizations plan to implement some level of proactive customer engagement in the contact center by 2025.This year, brands in almost every vertical will need to build strategies on how to effectively balance customer acquisition and retention while managing strained budgets. If it is a sales & marketing teams\u2019 role to bring in customers, it is\ncustomer service\u2019s role to retain them. This focus on customer retention yields a higher return on investments by building brand loyalists and recurring business. Optimizing this important business function is an effective marketing strategy\nand will determine whether a brand can overcome challenging economic environments.Read the original article at https://bit.ly/3YSWI3N"}

Yet, deciphering which BPO is the best fit is often a difficult task.Luckily, leading CX research firm Gartner has released its much-awaited 2022 Magic Quadrant report for Customer Service BPO.In doing so, the analyst isolates the strengths and cautions of global BPO players, enabling companies to whittle down their prospects and pinpoint leaders in the field.Evaluating the service of 17 prominent operators in the space, Gartner identifies ten market leaders.The Definition of a Customer Service BPOGartner defines a customer service business process outsourcer (BPO) as a third party handling delegated customer service-related activities to assist clients.Such activities may include supporting technology implementations and integrations, infrastructure management, and reporting, alongside contact handling across various channels.BPOs within the 2022 Magic Quadrant must also demonstrate the following \u201ccore capabilities\u201d:Global operations with \u201conshore, nearshore, and offshore\u201d service deliveryExpertise and experience support clients across multiple industriesDigital services \u2013 including expertise in conversational AIKnowledge in utilizing the solutions of numerous customer service vendorsAgent support resources and servicesExperience in business process design, alongside business process managementInnovation and thought leadership across critical technology, people, and process areasWhen assessing the offerings of 17 BPOs that meet these criteria, Gartner divides each provider into four categories: Leaders, Challengers, Visionaries, and Niche Players. Here, we review them all.\u00a0THE 2022 CUSTOMER SERVICE BPO MAGIC QUADRANT LEADERS\nLeaders in the Magic Quadrant demonstrate a complete vision for supporting companies \u2013 across many sectors \u2013 in every aspect of their customer service. In addition, they boast a proven ability to execute this vision, providing worldwide service\ndelivery operations and vast experience in handling a myriad of CX technologies. This year\u2019s leaders are:TeleperformanceAloricaTTECAtentoHGSSitel GroupWiproTech MahindraSutherlandWebhelpTeleperformance\nBy revenue and geographical footprint, Teleperformance is the world\u2019s largest customer service BPO. Through its TP Cloud Campus, a bespoke work from home (WFH) platform, Teleperformance operates with a remarkable reach and scale. Gartner highlights\nthis as a critical strength that differentiates the outsourcer, alongside its digital innovation and impressive client retention rates.AloricaSupporting clients across 14 different industries, Alorica receives specific recognition in the Magic Quadrant report for its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gartner praises its newfound agility, enhanced WFH solution, and business continuity plans,\nalongside the BPO\u2019s ability to build \u201cpositive\u201d employee experiences, which has resulted in top-notch talent development and retention.TTECWith 62,000 employees spread over six continents, TTEC interacts with customers in 50 languages and dialects. Such capabilities enable a differentiated client experience, for which the BPO garners praise from Gartner. The market analyst also points towards\nthe AI-enabled functionality of the TTEC Digital and TTEC Engage platforms, alongside its intent mapping and intelligent routing solutions as significant strengths.AtentoHeadquartered in Madrid, Spain, Atento holds an ISO 56002 certification, unique for BPO vendors. As such, the company boasts advanced skills in developing and deploying innovations, with Gartner isolating its CCaaS and CEM integrations as a substantial\ndifferentiator. The research firm also highlights employee experience and biometrics-fuelled security processes as plus points.HGSWith customer service delivery operations in India, North America, the UK, UAE, Jamaica, and the Philippines, HGS benefits from a large global presence. Yet, no matter where the service team is based, its HGS PULSE platform provides extensive contact\ncenter analytics and insights into agent performance. Gartner applauds this capability alongside its support to clients who wish to deploy AI-enabled self-service.Sitel Group2021 was a big year for Sitel Group, acquiring SYKES. The deal increased its capacity to 167,000 employees working for clients across 18 different industries. Meanwhile, the BPO also enhanced its EXP+ and Sitel MAX platforms, with the latter bolstering\nemployee experiences. Perhaps this contributes to the high employee satisfaction rates highlighted in the report, which also commends Sitel for its data security and risk mitigation solutions.WiproWith 17 global design studios, Wipro is a BPO that prioritizes innovation. Gartner recognizes this, noting its extensive technology portfolio as a forte, enabling clients to customize CX solutions that enhance assisted and unassisted channel performance.\nIn 2021, Wipro furthered these capabilities \u2013 alongside customer journey mapping tools, digital transformation expertise, and cross-industry knowledge \u2013 with a series of acquisitions.Tech MahindraThe third leader with its headquarters in India, Tech Mahindra is expanding with 28 operations centers in 15 countries.

Authored by Bong Borja | Alorica Chief Operating Officer\u00a0Why Offshoring CX Makes Perfect \u201cCents\u201d Even During a Tough Financial MarketEven in times of economic normalcy, companies are constantly looking for ways to manage costs and increase efficiency. When there is a potential economic downturn on the horizon, these measures become exponentially more critical. Nearshoring and offshoring\ncustomer experience (CX) services, often considered during high-growth periods, can be just as strong of a solution for brands looking to improve service delivery while reducing cost. Recent\nresearch from Zippia found that organizations can save up to 90% in labor costs by overseas outsourcing. Although outsourcing customer service to countries with lower labor costs can significantly decrease a company\u2019s\nexpenses, it does not come without risks. Some businesses have experienced a drop in customer satisfaction after offshoring CX support, with communication challenges or perceived lack of empathy or local nuanced understanding from contact center\nrepresentatives as common barriers. In aggregate, these CX fails taint a brand\u2019s reputation, diminishing the overall return a company can expect from offshoring. However, when deployed thoughtfully and with the right strategic business process outsourcing (BPO) partner, it can open up a world of opportunities, providing increased agility and resiliency to\nan important business function. When assessing CX outsourcers for the rest of this year and beyond, businesses should consider the following factors. An Infrastructure That is Reliable and FlexibleOffshoring customer service, back office and tech support has a number of benefits. It provides companies with access to a larger pool of workers; it makes voice support possible in every time zone;\nand it keeps costs down. The underlying assumption behind these benefits is that the infrastructure is already in place to carry out these services and business continuity is a given.\u00a0 While reliable internet and phone connections cannot be taken for granted, there are other infrastructure needs for standing up a CX operation. For example, companies must find and retain talent that can provide high-quality customer service, which\ncan be a challenge when outsourced contact centers are geographically far away. In terms of physical needs, offshoring can make it difficult to maintain and secure facilities and equipment that power contact center operations. But the best BPOs\ncan overcome these hurdles with technology that enables CX delivery regardless of geographic location. Using the same work-at-home model that has been successful in the United States, companies can increase their talent pool abroad and circumvent\nphysical infrastructure requirements through cloud-based digital solutions. These full-service platforms enable BPOs to easily hire and train talent who are more amenable to remote options. Because contingent workers in 2023 often desire flexibility,\na work-at-home model will assist recruiting efforts and improve the employee experience, lowering the attrition rate in the process. BPOs that already have a presence in developed countries can therefore rapidly deploy talent for optimal productivity\nwithout the typical overhead costs common in the United States.An Empowered Workforce Powered by Technology Many countries, such as the Philippines and Jamaica, have large English-speaking populations who can perform high-demand CX functions. Finding and hiring qualified talent in these countries is not exactly difficult but training them can be. Some businesses\nthat have outsourced their CX delivery abroad have found that offshore service quality is not on par with domestic operations. A lot of the time, this can be attributed to a lack of understanding of the brand\u2019s products or US-based consumers,\nresulting in disconnected experiences that leave customers dissatisfied.Rather than limiting the talent pool to onshore hires, these pain points can oftentimes be solved for by leveraging digital tools. With today\u2019s AI technologies, brands should feel assured that agent-assist tools are quickly and accurately managing\ncustomer interactions. For example, translation technology can be used to bridge the language barrier on digital channels and ensure multilingual support. Additionally, for voice interactions, experienced BPOs have implemented tools such as noise-cancelling\nheadsets to eliminate background noise for agents working remotely, as well as accent neutralization so that customers and CX representatives from different geographies can easily understand one another.If there is an outlier agent struggling to perform, CX leaders should have reporting and analytics tools at the ready to adapt agent processes, workflows, and schedules in real-time. In the analog era, this type of hands-on approach was a challenge\neven for domestic operations. And with contact centers as a service (CCaaS) solutions that allow agents to access training materials and capture data in a single interface, CX leaders and their agents can be on the same page at all times. With\ntop-of-the-line technologies available to optimize workforces both at home and abroad, the only real challenge left is fostering the brand\u2019s culture and voice. A CX Representative Who Truly Represents the BrandWhen businesses are evaluating outsourcers and regions to offshore their CX needs, they need to look beyond the financials. Brands cannot afford to solely prioritize pricing over cultural fit, as the customer experience will inevitably take a hit\nas a result. To maintain a competitive edge with offshoring, companies must look to BPOs that have relevant experience in their industry and a track record of delivering outcomes that matter.The reason why companies don\u2019t open foreign contact centers on their own is not just due to facility maintenance, hiring talent, or retention challenges. It is also the Herculean effort that goes into ramping up an external workforce. To do\nit in a manner that allows new hires to develop a genuine allegiance to the brand they are representing is table stakes. While there is no denying that companies know their own brand and culture better than a BPO, the reality is that they may\nlack the skills and the experience necessary to turn offshore CX talent into brand ambassadors. When companies can quickly activate effective ambassadors in geographically optimal regions, they can then start to enjoy operational efficiency that\nleads to desired business outcomes including customer satisfaction and customer lifetime value. Only a few global BPOs are trusted to do this by blue-chip brands. When assessing nearshoring and offshoring options, it\u2019s best to engage organizations\nthat have credibility for turning new talent into trusted CX solutionists.So, before dismissing the idea of offshoring based on the current financial climate, brands should consider how this move may save their reputation with an ROI that will pay dividends in the long run."}

Authored by Scott Clark | Journalist\u00a0\u00a0Generative and Conversational AI Vastly Improved ChatbotsGenerative and conversational AI have significantly enhanced chatbots, making them more dynamic and user-friendly. These AI models have a deep understanding of natural language, which enables them to understand complex user queries and provide more\naccurate, human-like responses.Unlike rule-based chatbots, generative and conversational AI are able to generate their own responses, which leads to more flexible and dynamic conversations. They also have a strong grasp of context and remember past interactions so they are able\nto use that information to provide relevant responses. These AI models also excel in handling queries that are uncertain. If a user's request isn't clear, the AI can ask follow-up questions to clarify, much like a human would. This ability greatly\nenhances the user's experience and ensures more effective communication.Generative and conversational AI models are able to understand and respond in multiple languages, a feature that makes them invaluable for businesses serving customers globally. They are also able to handle a large volume of queries simultaneously,\nproviding instant responses and reducing wait times.Mike Clifton, chief growth and transformation officer at Alorica, a customer service BPO provider, told CMSWire that chatbots and virtual assistants have become staples of modern CX, creating a win-win situation for customers and contact centers with\nbenefits such as shorter wait times, quicker and easier access as well efficient responses. \"While these gains have disrupted and transformed the industry, we\u2019re really experiencing a greater level of that with generative AI. Generative\nAI represents a giant step forward in digital transformation and offers tremendous opportunities for companies and consumers everywhere,\u201d said Clifton, who explained that generative AI has enabled contact centers to automate tasks and analyze\ndata with unparalleled accuracy and speed.Over time, generative and conversational AI learn from past interactions.

With leading brands beginning to deploy generative AI in the enterprise setting, customer service has emerged as a key\ntesting ground, which shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise. As the sector with\u00a0\u201cone of the highest adoption rates of AI technologies,\u201d\u00a0the\ncustomer experience (CX) industry is no stranger to AI. According to a\u00a02022 Gartner survey, 54% of its 50 respondents indicated they have started to implement\nAI for customer-facing applications.While chatbots and virtual assistants have become a staple of modern CX, these innovations only scratch the surface of generative AI\u2019s future impact on contact centers. Generative AI is well suited to address CX needs not only for its real-time\nconversational and comprehensive capabilities but also for its ability to analyze big data quickly and in-depth. As companies begin to experiment with generative AI across their operations, they should prioritize two critical areas for these early\nefforts: enabling agents and data analytics.But first, it\u2019s important to understand the technology.Generative AI tools, like Open AI\u2019s ChatGPT and DALL-E, have generated a lot of buzz because they merge three exciting technologies: chatbots, natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLM). The end product is a solution designed\nto hold intelligent conversations with humans. The \u201cintelligence\u201d behind these new tools surpasses previous iterations of chatbots because they employ machine learning that uses pre-trained data sets. Its responses are detailed and complete\nand only improves the more it learns. The difference in output will revolutionize the way brands and consumers engage.But all new technologies come with their challenges. With generative AI, it may seem like an open sandbox without many rules or validation, making data bias and unverified content unavoidable. LLMs still\u00a0hallucinate\u2014in which, at times, their responses can be nonsensical but in an authoritative manner, making it difficult to question the accuracy\nof the content. Lack of access to nonpublic information limits the data set, and there are no structured parameters to maintain data integrity. Also, generative AI\u2019s responses are more human-like than ever, but they can\u2019t replace real\nhumans. It still lacks the empathy and problem-solving that you can only get from people. It can better pinpoint the inquiry or issue as well as the resolution more than any of its AI predecessors, but because it leverages rules and algorithms versus\nemotions, there\u2019s still a void that only humans can fill.Address the limitations of a near-limitless solution.Despite being intuitive tools that streamline tasks and ease operational burdens, generative AI can\u2019t replace the human touch that is best offered by an experienced hand. If companies decide to simply rely on generic and publicly available models\nthat don\u2019t have the safeguards or sophistication to handle knowledge bases and CRM platforms securely in enterprise-level deployments, then they are merely opening themselves up to undue risks. Brands would be doing themselves a favor by partnering\nwith service providers that have the institutional knowledge and expertise to successfully incorporate generative AI tools into their processes, which includes integrating them into core systems, managing accurate and dynamic protocols and product\ninformation, and applying business rules to overlay the technology. Also, brands should look into trust and safety services from leading tech and CX providers that have built-in security, governance and confidentiality that they can embed into their\ngenerative AI offerings.And when it comes to delivering the best CX, having a human backstop is essential. So, if a company is exploring a partnership involving generative AI, they should seek a clear vision upfront from the tech vendor and the CX services provider as to how\nthe technology could and would be deployed with humans in the loop. As researchers from Stanford and MIT shared from a recent\u00a0study: \u201cOur overall findings demonstrate that generative AI working alongside humans can have a significant positive impact on\nthe productivity and retention of individual workers.\u201dTailor the experience for customers and agents simultaneously.These capabilities describe the foundation of the ultimate contact center as a service (CCaaS). Now brands can envision a future where they\u2019re able to better support CX agents while meeting customer demands more effectively. Companies will also\nbe able to thoroughly examine these customer engagements, synthesize the data, and develop actionable insights much faster and more accurately than ever before. This can radically change customer support interactions in a way that benefits both customers\nas well as the representatives servicing them, creating fewer frustrating experiences on both sides.Generative AI is a truly game-changing technology that\u2019s not only here for the long run but blazing a trail for CX innovation to come. The best way to harness its full potential is to explore its capabilities, test them and apply the solution to\ndeliver outcomes\u2014right from the front lines."}

This revolutionary technology has not only stirred unprecedented excitement in the business sphere but has also transitioned almost instantaneously from the depths of specialized tech to a broad consumer and enterprise fascination. Generative AI is democratizing the use of artificial intelligence by making it more approachable, as exemplified by powerful tools such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Bard.ChatGPT has rapidly become a commonplace term. Since its launch in November 2022, it amassed a staggering 100 million users within just two months, setting a new record for the fastest-growing consumer app in internet history. It\u2019s clear that generative AI is well on its course to solidifying a significant place in the world of customer experience (CX) as well. Generative AI transcends being a fleeting business trend or marketing jargon; it is set to be a catalyst for transformation in the CX industry.Synergies with Contact CentersThe CX industry, already accustomed to AI technologies with one of the highest adoption rates, now welcomes generative AI, which extends far beyond the capabilities of traditional customer service methods, like automated chat responses or performing rudimentary tasks. As a Large Learning Model (LLM) used for Natural Language Processing (NLP), generative AI\u2019s unique ability to be trained on massive datasets makes it an invaluable asset to CX centers.Its versatility allows it to power self-service bots, automate email responses, and create comprehensive report summaries. Companies that have successfully integrated generative AI leverage it to handle unstructured data like conversations, chat interactions, and operating manuals. By doing so, they can extract meaningful insights from this formerly inaccessible \u201cdark data,\u201d offering businesses an unprecedented level of valuable intelligence.As generative AI continues to accurately automate tasks at a rapid pace, CX centers are quickly realizing its potential to cut costs without compromising on the quality of service delivery.Strategies for SuccessBloomberg Intelligence predicts that generative AI tools could generate revenues exceeding $1.3 trillion in the next decade, growing from the $40 billion achieved in 2022. This anticipated exponential growth solidifies generative AI\u2019s place in many enterprise tech budgets. In a competitive business environment where every interaction counts, brands can\u2019t afford to overlook or carelessly implement AI in their digital strategy.Companies should begin by familiarizing themselves with generative AI technologies and testing them to meet specific needs. After gaining a solid understanding and allowing the LLMs more time and data to learn from, leaders should then train and support their employees in using these tools. In doing so, they will better understand the technology\u2019s capabilities and limitations, and then apply that knowledge to optimize the customer experience in the most impactful ways.Navigating Potential ChallengesHowever, as the deployment of generative AI grows, so do the associated concerns. To leverage the true value of generative AI and avoid hindering digital transformation, it\u2019s crucial to understand when and how to deploy it effectively. While generative AI excels in analyzing and synthesizing vast datasets, there\u2019s always the risk of an interaction failure between a customer and the brand, necessitating a human backup. Balancing human and AI involvement is key to delivering successful customer experiences and maintaining enduring brand relationships.Given the rapid application and expansion of generative AI, establishing governance to keep pace with its development is critical. Comprehensive guidelines, set by tech providers, consumers, and regulators, will protect generative AI from misuse and ensure it continues to enhance the lives of organizations and consumers alike."}

Germain | Writer\u00a0| Reposted from CRMBuyerOpenAI\u2019s innovative artificial intelligence breakthrough with ChatGPT presents advancements in retail marketing and uplifting improvements in customer experience (CX) solutions.Launched by OpenAI in November 2022 as a prototype, ChatGPT \u2014 or Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer \u2014 has become increasingly popular across multiple industries. With recent releases, its chatbox structure built on the GPT family of large language models (LLM) delivers detailed responses and articulate answers across many knowledge domains.Generative AI\u2019s futuristic capability lets users quickly generate content based on a variety of inputs. This approach also brings new tools that optimize e-commerce and marketing campaigns.Present and future use cases are not only fascinating but can truly help deliver promises to customers, according to Harry Folloder, chief digital officer at CX solutions firm\u00a0Alorica. It focuses on finding the best correct answer by layering on generative AI within and on top of other tool sets to deliver the service promised in a much quicker manner.\u201cGenerative AI is literally a whole new ballgame. Utilizing those large language models allows context to be uniquely created on each [human] interaction,\u201d he told CRM Buyer.However, it\u2019s still uncertain whether employing generative AI in marketing and CRM operations can circumvent potential programming abuses and ChatGPT inaccuracies.A related question is: Can guardrails prevent AI\u2019s machine learning (ML) and LLM based on natural language processing (NLP) from running amok?Enhanced Features Pose Abuse PotentialEfforts to improve CX capabilities for marketers and retailers offer much-anticipated solutions within businesses. But generative AI left unchecked can damage brands\u2019 reputations, experts warn. Folloder does not disagree with the need for built-in guardrails on AI\u2019s capabilities to prevent runaway behavior and results.Key to this concern is this nagging question: Can Generative AI pass the Turing test for human intelligence in computers?Earlier AI implementations were mostly limited to results based on pre-trained sequences. AI could only do what it was programmed to do. Generative AI, on the other hand, has the potential to create human-quality artifacts at scale that include fake and misleading written, visual, and audio content.As AI developers experiment with incorporating safety guardrails, a long-established measuring method may help keep AI programming from leading to unchecked \u201cfree thinking\u201d by AI networks. The Turing test, devised by the English mathematician Alan M. Turing in 1950, is a simple method to determine a computer\u2019s ability to demonstrate human intelligence via thinking.To pass this test and thus demonstrate human intelligence, AI-enhanced computers must engage in a conversation with a human without being detected as a machine. No computer has come close to passing the Turing test yet.But that threshold might well be just around the next corner.Curation Accuracy Is the ThingFor CX experts, the primary goals are to provide customers with accurate answers, mitigate their frustration, and enhance their overall experience. Folloder underscores that the ultimate aspiration of AI-driven CX is to solve problems more effectively and to strengthen brand protection.Consider this new technology as possessing the capability to explore all information sources without restrictions. The absence of search limits endows generative AI with unlimited access to new materials, enriching the integrative process for its results.\u201cAt the speed of compute, you can propagate that information or something that seems harmless on the surface and the computing world. But it could be brand tarnishing in the real world,\u201d he warned.Striking the right balance when curating content within an AI platform necessitates consideration for client protection, posited Folloder. He thinks that is one of the essential factors left unanswered currently.\u201cImagine giving a program the ability to search everything on the internet. How we use it allows you to basically fence in the content from this search or not,\u201d he said. \u201cKey to this ongoing discussion is the approaching ability of generative AI to cross the computer intelligence boundary.\u201dEnter the Turing TestThis context is where the Turing test may become a controlling factor. Its background is significant to the discussion.While at the University of Manchester, Turing wrote a paper detailing his thought experiment called \u201cThe Imitation Game.\u201d In it, he predicted that by the year 2000, a computer \u201cwould be able to play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than a 70% chance of making the right identification (machine or human) after five minutes of questioning.\u201dTuring\u2019s work in 1939 helped the British intelligence agency MI6 crack German codes, including the infamous Enigma Machine. Those efforts are loosely portrayed in a 2014 movie titled \u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d based on the 1983 biography \u201cAlan Turing: The Enigma\u201d by Andrew Hodges.Ongoing rapid advancements in AI are raising alarm bells globally about the need to build safeguards, whether for business use cases or beyond \u2014 as discussed in April on TechNewsWorld\u2019s\u00a0The AI Revolution Is at a Tipping Point.At this point, we see limitations in the technology. How long will those limitations remain until software developers install guardrails? Folloder interjected.As more consumers engage with brand-integrated generative AI, some will try to test its limits. The Turing test remains a challenging threshold for Generative AI to cross.Unpacking the Potential and Pitfalls of Gen AIWe pressed Folloder to elaborate on the necessary advances in the areas of contextual understanding, emotional intelligence, and decision-making within AI. We also asked him to share his expertise on how generative AI can meet the demands of complex customer interactions without overstepping safety limits.CRM Buyer: Do you think that generative AI can ever pass the Turing test?Harry Folloder:\u00a0The Turing test still applies because you can still easily tell that it is not a human by asking it a simple logic question. But it has the ability now to utilize LLM in a conversation that would be more humanistic.What is the deciding factor in your safety concerns with generative AI?Folloder:\u00a0The logic is still missing today. So you could still easily confuse it and trick it. There are tons of different things on different social media platforms showing you how you can easily mislead these AI things to write malicious code for you or tell you things against its programmed ethics.How comfortable are you with the potential for generative AI to do no harm?Folloder:\u00a0I spent a few years inside the intelligence community for the United States government focusing on building cyber practices and building SATCOM for the White House. And so I\u2019m probably not a great person to ask that because I see it in everything.It has already been proven to be used in malicious manners. There are cyber terrorists that have used the power of this AI tool to make their malware better to construct key loggers that have the ability to bypass modern-day safety components.What must be done to make generative AI Safer?Folloder:\u00a0That is the key question! I think an extremely large, multibillion-dollar business will spin up around just that because there are really no great answers today. AI is growing faster than we can keep up with the protective terms of it.So, you doubt much can be done other than ban its use like some European countries have already done?Folloder:\u00a0I do not have a great answer because I do not think there is one yet. I am conflicted because it is such an incredible technology that needs to be further used and perpetuated for good. But they are not wrong in their fears. This technology has a ton of ability to do a lot of harm if not properly watched."}

Authored by George Lawton | Journalist and Jonathan\nBordoli | Technical Project Manager\u00a0Customers no longer tolerate irrelevant emails and advertisements. Instead, they expect brands to understand and anticipate their needs, then tailor their experiences to them. That's why\u00a0personalization\u00a0is often a make-or-break factor in customer experience.What is a personalized customer experience?\nCustomer experience personalization is about designing products and services to meet customers' individual needs and matching them with those offerings.Brands can implement targeted advertisements when they understand customers, including their\u00a0previous buying trends and demographic data points,\nsuch as age, gender, income level, race, employment, location, homeownership and level of education. Demographic data can encompass all characteristics of the buyer, including preferences, hobbies and lifestyle choices.Why is a personalized customer experience important?In an increasingly commoditized world, a brand's CX -- rather than its product or service -- is the differentiator. If at least two suppliers have the same or a similar offering, then organizations must strive to deliver superior CX. A customer's experience\nstrongly influences brand loyalty, which then influences\u00a0customer retention. Personalization serves as a key part of the customer\nexperience to differentiate businesses from competitors as well as to both attract and retain customers.Common pitfalls of personalization effortsWhile personalization can benefit both customers and businesses, it also brings forth a handful of challenges. Those include the following:Poor data quality.\u00a0The quality of customer data defines the effectiveness of the personalization. The\u00a0best data comes directly from the customer,\naccording to Colson Hillier, CMO at Alorica, a business process outsourcing consultancy. This data includes buying patterns, preferences and interests. If the information is not from reliable sources or comes from a third-party vendor, it can\nbe misguided or completely off target.\nRead the full article at:\u00a0https://bit.ly/3QswBzk"}

However, ensuring trust and safety for both brands and consumers goes beyond protecting against these bad actors. Sometimes, it can come in the form of misinformation, abusive content, or a hack from a video or bot.According to Forrester\u2019s U.S.\u00a02023 Customer Experience Index, a mere 6% of brands reported significant improvement in 2023 despite 80% of business leaders recognizing the importance of enhancing CX. Despite the investments and commitments brands make to creating quality CX, leaders too often miss critical engagement points in the customer journey, failing to manage the risks and opportunities of reaching their customer base.Instilling and maintaining a trustworthy, safe and engaging customer experience (CX) along each step of the journey with your brand can help pay dividends in terms of brand loyalty, share of wallet, lifetime value and building trust. One misstep in CX and all those dollars spent in related areas are wasted. Today\u2019s CX Challenges And TrendsEven companies that already understand the value of curating a seamless, consistent customer journey across all touchpoints and platforms are facing new, evolving challenges and opportunities. Among the most pressing are the following trends.Proliferation And Fragmentation Of Social PlatformsAs of 2022, the U.S. has the third-largest social media audience worldwide, behind China and India; today, it is home to more than\u00a0302 million users\u00a0at a penetration rate of 90%. Social media\u2019s meteoric rise has ushered in a new era of customer engagement, where brands are expected to be present and responsive on various social networks.From Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) to Twitch and Discord, customers now expect a rapid response to queries and complaints made on their favorite platforms. Social media has been transformational in CX, not just for adding a new channel to the customer journey but also for changing customer support from a one-to-one communication model to a one-to-many engagement approach. However, it raises the stakes of engaging customers in an authentic, timely and effective way through this medium.To adapt to this new model, brands should have clear policies and guidelines for their social media presence. This requires a clear understanding of each popular social platform and how its customers use them, acknowledging that there may be a significant generational divide. For example, almost 40% of Gen Z\u00a0use TikTok and Instagram\u00a0as their search engines over Google. Brands must consider the reputation and reliability of the social platforms they use and ensure they align with their overall social strategy, as association with a platform that showcases controversial content can negatively impact their image.User-Generated ContentMost content on the top social media platforms is user-generated. The beauty of user-generated content is that it enables brands to connect with their customers and prospects in a personal and creative way. Furthermore, satisfied customers are the best possible brand advocates for future customers, as there is power in community validation and endorsements.The ugly side of user-generated content is that it can be a vehicle for misinformation and negative spamming. Social platforms often struggle with moderating content effectively. Consequently, the lack of control over user-generated content on some platforms poses real risks to businesses.Brands can address this concern in a few ways before negative brand experiences become amplified. It\u2019s important to closely monitor and \u201clisten\u201d on these platforms. Be prepared for different scenarios and respond in real time to build trust. When responding or interacting with those who are sharing negative user-generated content, it\u2019s critical to be authentic and helpful by acknowledging the situation and providing various options to resolve issues while demonstrating empathy. Brands can also work with CX solution providers to further handle these issues. Look for providers that have experience with trust and safety services.Generative AIAdvanced technologies are changing the way businesses can put out content and interact with customers. The benefit of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in CX is that they can help create better, more efficient customer service models. If implemented correctly, these models can help brands deliver a faster, easier, and more personalized customer journey at scale.Despite all the promise, there are some drawbacks with these technologies. For example, most AI solutions cannot catch or decipher every social media engagement. Generative AI models, such as deep learning models used for text or image generation, can often fall victim to digital hallucinations, where the AI generates outputs that seem untethered from reality.In addition, these technologies create the conditions for bad actors to thrive. Whether that is in the form of deepfakes made possible by AI\u2019s ability to replicate a voice, or through malicious coding that allows hacking into systems. Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize customer service as we know it, but it necessitates human intervention.How To Stay Ahead Of The CurveCompanies that leverage AI for good but aren\u2019t over-reliant on the technology will be best positioned to navigate the new landscape. Balance will be key. That means that user-generated content is encouraged and supported but also vigilantly monitored and safeguarded.CX teams have to be prepared to respond and resolve issues no matter the time or platform. To do this effectively, companies can consult with CX experts to monitor and manage at scale, implement best practices and identify gaps as well as train models.The growing ubiquity of digital platforms, always-on connected commerce, user-generated content and generative AI create an ever-expanding array of brand risks. Alongside these potential threats, technology advances also open the door to new opportunities for enhanced consumer engagement, rooted in a deep understanding of the changing nature of the customer journey, and a proactive approach to trust and safety. When it comes to best-in-class CX, one size does not fit all. A custom approach that is flexible enough to evolve with rapidly changing consumer expectations is critical to brand success."}

With travel spending on par to meet 2022 levels, air travel demand strong, and both leisure and business travel expected to contribute to\u00a0significant growth, brands across the industry should be poised to capture their share\nof the market.\u00a0One of the best ways to attract and retain customers in this industry is through digital personalization\u2014showing them you understand their preferences and helping them connect the dots throughout user experience. However, grappling with\npersonalization across a plethora of platforms and touchpoints is not easy: Many brands either underwhelm or overdo it when customizing brand experiences.\u00a0Others may overlook the value of ensuring a great agent experience and the\nrole this plays in ensuring customers get the right resolution at the right time in the right place.Three pitfalls emerge when hotels and others in the hospitality sector consider\u00a0the path to personalized customer engagements: not taking full advantage of first-party data, placing undue trust in unreliable third-party data, and lacking\na precise understanding of the customer journey for targeted buyer personas.\u00a0\u00a0Utilizing What\u2019s Right in Front of YouData quality is pivotal to understanding customer attributes, attitudes, and preferences, all of which factor into tailoring experiences that drive desired behaviors (i.e. purchase). In most organizations today, there is no shortage of available\ndata, but knowing how and what to do with the data can prove challenging.\u00a0Businesses that ignore the data they\u2019ve worked hard to collect or don\u2019t know how to activate it to deliver seamless, connected, customized experiences, do so to their detriment.\u00a0The good news is that there\u2019s help available. With AI-enabled interaction analytics from a best-in-class partner, travel and hospitality brands benefit from actionable insights to improve performance and enhance the customer journey. Predictive\nmodeling and data mining further enhance the value of such third-party solutions.\u00a0Not All Data Is Created EqualBut, brands beware. Just because you have access to data doesn\u2019t mean it will be useful \u2013 or even accurate. You have to do the pre-work to ensure the data is clean. Leveraging data from far-removed, untrusted third parties can be a\nhigh-risk proposition.\nWhen you receive an email blast addressed to \u201cDear travel industry professional,\u201d with no name \u2013 or worse, your name is misspelled, how likely are you to feel like the brand reaching out truly knows and values who you are and\nwhat you care about? To solve for this risk to brand reputation and customer share of wallet, it\u2019s imperative to recognize the distinctions between first-, second- and third-party data; know how to maximize the value of each; and understand\nwhat it takes to integrate all three to create seamless, tailored, and contextually relevant consumer journeys.\u00a0Working with a full-service\u00a0BPO is ideal\u00a0to steer clear of such situations. With CX consulting and design thinking, the right partner can help guide your strategy, distilling your brand\u2019s unique mission, pain points and customer\nengagement objectives to provide insightful and customized digital intervention with advanced automation tools.\u00a0Customer Journey Mapping for the WinTo achieve hyper-personalized brand engagements, context is everything and customer journey mapping ensures you get it right. Do you have a clear, comprehensive picture of how your customers initially interact with your brand, which platforms\nthey prefer, how many times they engage before making a purchase decision, where they\u2019re most likely to stall or drop out of the sales funnel?Unfortunately, it\u2019s all too common for brands today to have little or no clarity around the many pathways their customers take from awareness and consideration to purchase, retention and advocacy. Mapping these journeys \u2013 yes, there\nwill be more than one road from A to Z given distinct customer personas \u2013 is critical.\u00a0\u00a0The solution lies in collaboration with an experienced digital CX provider. By integrating next-gen technology, unifying a comprehensive suite of digital solutions, and offering analytics and consulting, the right partner can enable hospitality\nand tourism companies to transform the brand experience with a thorough understanding of customer preferences, call drivers, and friction points across channels and processes.Working in lockstep with a best-in-class customer service partner, one leading airline not only gained clarity on its unique consumer journeys, the brand was also able to quantify customer and support agent pain points, then use this information\nto optimize its contact model and drive additional revenue. When disruption occurs \u2013 think weather or mechanical-related delays \u2013 this same detailed understanding of customer engagement preferences propels brands to pivot easily\nand swiftly, delivering the best possible experience.\u00a0When done well with an expert combination of digital solutions and experienced personnel \u2013 an airline website defaulting to your seat preference, a hotel reservation system that automatically puts you in your desired room type, a cruise\nline customer service rep who offers up shore excursion packages ideally suited to your interests \u2013 personalized experiences are marketing gold. They drive brand loyalty and \u2013 perhaps more importantly \u2013 create brand advocates.\nHigh quality, trusted, and privacy compliant data is key to bringing this to life. So too, is partnering with industry-leading CX experts to supplement your internal resources, complement brand-native expertise, and deliver delightful consumer\nexperiences at every step along the customer journey."}

Uses CSR to Attract and Retain Talent (Case Study)\nHow Alorica Inc. Uses CSR to Attract and Retain Talent (Case Study)\nPublished on February 3, 2020\nShare this\nYoung professionals view a company\u2019s culture and value system as extremely important.This could influence their decision to join or stay with a company. CX and call center outsourcing company, Alorica, has effectively leveraged CSR to acquire and\nretain top-tier professionals. Today, we share this success story, as told to us by Joyce Lee, chief culture officer at Alorica.Experts recommend numerous ways to retain top talent. While some focus on improving employee engagement, others focus on benefits and compensation. In this article, we see an example of a company using corporate social responsibility (CSR) to retain employees.\nThe link between CSR and\u00a0employee retention\u00a0is well-documented.\u00a0Researchers from Fu Jen Catholic University found\u00a0that CSR efforts go a long way in fulfilling key employee needs related to \"existence, relatedness, and growth (ERG).\"\nThe study also found that CSR has a positive impact on employee satisfaction and their intent to stay on at a company.Millennials and Generation Z employees pay particular attention to a company\u2019s CSR footprint. A\u00a0survey of 1,000+ U.K.-based professionals\u00a0revealed that 86% of these segments would stay with a company for an extended period if the company\nreported on how it lowers its impact on the environment.\nGiven these trends, we decided to explore how CSR could aid retention and help employers stand out in a tight labor marketplace. In an exclusive with\u00a0Joyce Lee, chief culture officer at\u00a0Alorica, we discussed how the company has successfully leveraged CSR as a part of its retention strategy.\nAbout Alorica and Its Approach to CSR for Retention\nAlorica is a customer experience and call center outsourcing solutions provider with offices across the world.\nThe company has been regularly recognized for its workplace initiatives and business performance. In 2018, it was named BPO of the Year by the CCW Excellence Awards. It was also named the best company for women by Comparably in 2017.\nAlorica recognizes the human impact of the outsourcing industry, including added stress and a poor quality of work-life balance.\u00a0Research by Eastern Illinois University\u00a0found that outsourcing could have a \u201cnegative impact on the perceived\nquality of work-life dimensions.\u201d To address this, Alorica has introduced the concept of socially responsible outsourcing as part of its CSR efforts.\nWe asked Lee to elaborate on this concept and how it helps to attract talent.\n\"Socially Responsible Outsourcing (SRO) is about doing the outsourcing business in a way that betters our society. It's about ensuring fair treatment of all employees, giving a hand up by providing jobs, creating opportunities for career progression,\nupholding ethical business practices, and building up communities,\" Lee told us.\n\u201cSRO is important to Alorica for two reasons: first, it aligns with our CSR goals of making lives better in our communities, and second, it helps emphasize our do-good culture and reputation among our employees and job candidates, which is vital\nfor recruiting and retention,\u201d she said.\n\u201cNot only do we want to proudly promote that this is what Alorica is all about, but we also want like-minded people to join the family and help us make that difference,\u201d she added.\nThe Intrinsic Link Between the Younger Generation, CSR, and Retention\nLee mentioned that at Alorica, CSR is a core component of their strategy. \"As much as it's our recruitment/marketing strategy, it's also simply a by-product of our CSR mission. Alorica's commitment to CSR is about doing the right thing and taking\ncare of one another like family, which is an integral part of who we are as a company. We live up to these objectives by focusing on what we call our 3 P's: Philanthropy, People, and Planet.\u201d\nAlorica employs over 100,000 workers in 14 countries, a significant portion of which comprises millennials and Gen Z. To attract the best talent in these demographics and retain them for the longest possible time, Alorica prioritizes CSR.\nThe company\u2019s flagship CSR program is built on its philanthropy efforts. Interestingly, 36% of respondents in the U.K. survey we cited view charity partnerships as extremely important. Alorica partners with the global non-profit, Making Lives Better\nwith Alorica (MLBA).\nThe non-profit operates through approximately 90 chapters around the globe, empowering Alorica employees to undertake CSR activities.\n\"Since inception [of Alorica's CSR program] in 2015, our employees have raised over $5 million through the local chapters and have given out more than 9,000 grants. We've seen that our commitment to doing the right thing resonates with our employees and\nis one of the strongest\u00a0recruiting tools\u00a0we have,\u201d commented Lee.\nShe continues, \u201cOur agent population, a majority of which are millennials and Gen Z, are passionate about working for mission-focused companies with strong values where they feel like they can be a part of something bigger than themselves. And we\u2019re\nproud to be one of those companies.\u201d\nAlorica\u2019s Retention Levels Have Gained From Its CSR Footprint\nWe were interested in learning if Alorica\u2019s experience with leveraging CSR for retention mirrors the research figures cited above. Lee told us that \u201cAloricans who actively participate in MLBA tend to stay with the company longer.\u201d\nEmphasizing further on the \u201chuman\u201d impact of their CSR program, she said, \u201cWhat I\u2019ve found to be even more powerful than the stats, is the testimonials\u2026those whose lives we\u2019ve been able to touch through our CSR, many\nwho are our very own employees and their families.\u201d\nAnd CSR at Alorica goes beyond the confines of its workplace, with employees actively working with the charity and making positive contributions. Lee calls this a \u201cpay-it-forward mindset,\u201d where employees who receive assistance contribute\nto the cycle of giving back.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the combination of empowerment and connection behind our CSR that encourages Aloricans around the world to choose us and stay with us,\u201d Lee mentioned.\nIn Short, CSR Is a True Catalyst for Retention in 2020\nToday, employees consider more than just compensation and job role before joining a company.\nAn\u00a0international survey\u00a0found that 77% of 5,000+ respondents carefully consider a company's culture before applying. An active CSR program that is inherent to the company\u2019s culture, its values, and mission statement, and is part of the\nbusiness strategy, just like it is at Alorica, can not only attract but also retain quality talent at your organization.\nAnd apart from CSR, Alorica adopts strategies like full-time\u00a0work from home\u00a0and classroom-to-career progression to attract the best possible talent.\nIn 2020, one of the key\u00a0talent retention strategies\u00a0companies can apply is proactively embracing CSR to drive retention and streamline recruitment. Over time, this will translate into a more \u201cpurpose-first\u201d work culture where employees\nare motivated to bring their best self to work \u2013 as well as to the society around them \u2013 every day.\nWritten by Chiradeep BasuMallick, this article originally appeared in HR Technologist: http://bit.ly/2OuPLnA."}
{"_id": "doc_204", "title": "Three Ways Hospitality Brands Can Woo Customers", "text": "https://alorica.com/news/detail/three-ways-hospitality-brands-can-woo-customers\nHome\nIn The News\nThree Ways Hospitality Brands Can Woo Customers\nThree Ways Hospitality Brands Can Woo Customers\nPublished on August 27, 2021\nShare this\nAs vaccinations continue to roll out in the midst of the peak summer season, the number of eager travelers has increased. In fact, more than 50% of Americans said they have 2021 summer travel plans, and 31% said they planned to book a flight at some point in the next 12 months. That said, not all airlines, hotels or other hospitality brands may be prepared for an uptick in\nactivity, especially if they had to reduce their staff since the beginning of the pandemic. For many consumers, this has likely meant longer than normal customer service wait times \u2014 much longer. For brands, this influx signals a prime opportunity to\nreengage with consumers eager to return to some sense of normalcy. Frontline employees are vitally important to ensuring customers are satisfied. As the CMO of a company that provides strategic customer experience (CX) support across industries, including\ntravel and hospitality, I believe hospitality businesses can follow three simple steps to keep customer satisfaction at the forefront of all operations\nduring this critical industry rebound.\nInstill Customer ConfidenceFor many people who are planning to travel this summer and beyond, there will be a lot of \u201cfirsts\u201d since the pandemic began: first plane ride, first hotel stay, first inside dining experience and so on. Not only that, but consumers are likely also returning\nto these pastimes with higher expectations and standards of courtesy, including more personal space, extra sanitation, regular temperature checks and the like. Re-earning a customer\u2019s trust and respect in this new normal starts by showing that you care.\nWith an unusual chance to make a second first impression, hospitality companies that commit to higher levels of care could be more likely to secure long-term customers and establish a deeper sense of loyalty.\nIncrease Staffing By Providing A Superior Employee ExperienceIf more travelers resume their vacations, it may be necessary to hire more staff to handle the influx of customer inquiries. It\u2019s important to make a concerted effort to identify, hire and retain top talent. Despite this, The Wall Street Journal reported (paywall) that hotels are having a particularly difficult time finding employees. Focusing on the employee experience remains a critical component\nto establishing a strong and steady talent pool. This includes efficient onboarding strategies, continued check-ins to pinpoint and address concerns upfront, and improved accommodations for those reentering the workforce. The happier your employees are,\nthe better service they\u2019ll provide to your customers. Employees will likely feel a similar hesitancy to that of customers who are cautious about resuming the activities of regular life. Employers should acknowledge those concerns and continue to prioritize\nemployee safety and well-being for greater retention. It's become even more evident that the employee experience and customer satisfaction are largely intertwined. In fact, 2016 Temkin Group research found that companies that lead in customer experience have 1.5 times as many engaged employees as those that lag in customer experience.\nMake Technology Upgrades To Fill GapsEven when human agents can\u2019t accommodate all of their requests, customers still need to feel heard. Technology upgrades will help fill any holes and ensure seamless customer care. For example, AI chatbots can give consumers the ability to engage with any brand at any time and from any device \u2014 which can help offset long wait times that can frustrate even the most patient customers. (Full disclosure: My company offers\nAI chatbots.) Investing in improved technology upfront can help keep customers satisfied and encourage future bookings, even after the busy summer months come to a close. Even those who may have been skeptical about high-tech bots in the past may be more\nopen to the idea now given the benefits of real-time customer service. To implement chatbots without compromising the customer experience, businesses should keep more complex inquiries in the hands of human agents who can deliver high-touch and personalized\nservice while automating those interactions that are simpler and occur more frequently. If the customer may need to speak to or receive a call back from a representative, it\u2019s probably not the right use case for a bot. Every brand today is trying to find\nits footing again while also navigating an increasingly interconnected, omnichannel customer journey, which is no easy feat. To succeed, they should not resume their hospitality operations exactly as they conducted them before, but instead should adapt\nto meet customers where they are \u2014 and oftentimes in non-traditional ways. Though the ride can get bumpy, the industry has a chance to win over consumers, both new and existing, in brand-new ways. To read the full article go to: https://bit.ly/3myUF4x"}

Soni | Principal Analyst, Impact Sourcing & Sustainability Research.\u00a0While not new concepts to the services industry, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the number of boardroom discussions on diverse hiring practices, especially with the ongoing talent shortage. Having a diverse workforce can provide numerous benefits, making it the way forward for the Business Process Services (BPS) industry. To learn more about why your organization should pay attention to supplier diversity, Impact Sourcing (IS), and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I), read on.\u00a0What do these terms mean?Supplier diversity:\u00a0Constitutes the percentage of diverse providers within an enterprise\u2019s supplier portfolio. This overarching term means encouraging partnering with businesses owned by minorities, women, veterans and service-disabled\nveterans, members of the LGBT community, and other historically underutilized businesses, and small business concerns for business procurementImpact sourcing:\u00a0Socially responsible business process outsourcing that enables global companies to improve business outcomes by hiring and providing career development opportunities to people who generally have limited employment\nprospectsDE&I:\u00a0According to datapeople.io:\nDiversity is the demographic makeup of an organization\u2019s workforce. The unique aspects that make one person different from another person is diversity, whether it\u2019s gender, ethnicity, physical ability, age, national origin, socioeconomic background,\nreligion, or a combination of any of those aspects (known as intersectionality)Equity levels an uneven playing field by providing everyone with equal access to opportunityInclusion is the environment an organization fosters for candidates and employees. An inclusive workplace is one where all candidates and employees feel welcome. It provides all candidates with equal opportunities for employment, job success,\nand organizational advancement\u00a0Why should we pay attention?Diversity is an important conversation happening right now because hiring individuals with diverse backgrounds and thoughts can result in greater innovation and more creativity. Bringing together different perspectives influenced by varied life experiences\ncan enhance the creation, function, and delivery of products and services. Along with this richness in thinking come tangible financial benefits beyond lower operational costs. Thus, impact sourcing is impactful sourcing \u2013 for the bottom line too!According to Everest Group research, hiring IS workers and having a diverse workforce can provide the following benefits:Tangible benefitsIntangible benefitsLower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0TCO for IS workers is 3-10%\u00a0 \u00a0less compared to traditional workers because of lower attrition costsGreater Employee Engagement\u00a0\u2013 Having an involved and motivated workforce generates long-term savings as companies spend less time recruiting and trainingOperational performance\u00a0\u2013 IS workers have a track record of meeting target Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)Competitive advantage\u00a0\u2013 Being viewed as a socially-responsible employer can help companies win business and attract employeesMultilingual/vernacular language services delivery\u00a0\u2013 Diversity and impact sourcing help companies access a large pool of skilled, high-potential yet under-utilized talentFulfillment of corporate social responsibility and diversity objectives\u00a0\u2013 Companies can contribute towards their CSR goals by employing IS and diverse workersLower attrition\u00a0\u2013 Attrition among IS workers is significantly lower than traditional workersDirect and indirect positive community impact\u00a0\u2013 Five to six family members or related individuals benefit from every IS worker hired\u00a0Why now?We\u2019re seeing the Great Resignation and a talent war play out in the services industry. As companies reassess their talent and hiring strategies and working models for the future of work, they\u2019re thinking about previously untapped talent in rural areas\nand tier-3 and -4 towns and cities. These locations have gained attractiveness due to the pandemic-induced mainstream prevalence of hybrid and remote working, ubiquitous high-speed internet, and infrastructure availability for a work-from-anywhere\nsetup.Hiring from diverse communities is a win-win for all, especially now. At the same time, establishing and practicing norms and values of inclusion and equity among employees will help foster more engaged and productive employees, lowering attrition and\nassociated new-hire training costs.Alorica is actively focusing on diversity; it\u2019s the largest minority-owned BPO and a global certified Minority Business Enterprise.

{"_id": "doc_208", "title": "4 Ways to Make DEI a Key Component of Customer Service and Culture", "text": "https://alorica.com/news/detail/4-ways-to-make-dei-a-key-component-of-customer-service-and-culture\nHome\nIn The News\n4 Ways to Make DEI a Key Component of Customer Service and Culture\n4 Ways to Make DEI a Key Component of Customer Service and Culture\nPublished on November 4, 2021\nShare this\nTruly effective customer service is rooted in empathy, because it\u2019s people who reach other people, and customers crave that kind of authenticity in their interactions with brands. A customer service representative sets the tone for how a customer will perceive and engage with the company going forward. The more diverse your people are, the more they can relate to a diverse customer base.\nCompanies that not only embrace \u2014 but champion \u2014 grassroots diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives are typically well positioned to deliver outstanding customer and employee experiences at every level and touch point. In order to do so, businesses must first focus on creating and preserving a happy, safe and healthy company culture that stems from nurturing a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce.\nCompanies that deliver the best customer experiences tap into empathy powered by the human element.\nWhen working to fine-tune company culture, start from the bottom up. Don\u2019t first dictate what the company\u2019s culture will be and then create programs or initiatives around it. Instead, connect with employees from diverse backgrounds with varied perspectives and priorities to learn what they think and what differences they want to make in the workplace and in their communities.\nFrom there, create the support, forums and opportunities for them to put forward solutions. But remember, program leaders should be careful to not assume or try to educate the masses, as social matters are localized by community.\nOutlined below are four key ways to help diversity, equity and inclusion take root as core elements of your company\u2019s culture:\nStart with an inclusive onboarding process\nRegardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, age, appearance or ability, customer service teams must be provided with the training and tools needed or their own success. Not every representative\u2019s onboarding experience should look or feel the same. Accordingly, you should design programs that take into account individual learning styles, physical accommodations and cultural considerations.\nNavigate each training experience so they are flexible and nimble to widen the talent pool as well as minimize stressors associated with onboarding. For example, deploy microlearning tactics where millennial and Gen Z employees can learn in short and visual video clips rather than through traditional manuals or lecture formats. Or provide screen readers for employees who are visually impaired and noise-cancelling headphones for those with hearing challenges.\nAlso set clear intentions on the front end to welcome and absorb employee feedback throughout their tenure. This could include regularly scheduled check-ins with each customer service rep at every phase \u2014 day 1, 30, 60, 90, etc. \u2014 alongside a \u201cconfidence meter\u201d to gauge how they\u2019re feeling about their progress.\nAs resources allow, consider implementing something like a digital, gamified website and mobile app that promotes engagement and permits feedback on the company onboarding process in real time. It will further encourage each person to come forward with questions or concerns in a way that is accessible and convenient for them, especially in today\u2019s remote-first work environments.\nHost interactive forums\nEmployees at all levels should be welcomed and encouraged to come together and discuss social issues that matter most to them and their communities and ideate tangible solutions to create positive change. Making an interactive forum available is the best way to accomplish these goals.\nWhat you learn from these forums may be used to tailor standard procedures or establish new ones. This is particularly useful for new managers to learn how to lead diverse teams effectively and in a way that most resonates with their employees.\nFor enterprises with a global workforce, these sessions will prove especially valuable in shedding light on universal issues and establishing a cohesive company culture that permeates borders. For example, mental health took center stage for employees across industries and throughout the world once the pandemic hit and remains a focus today.\nImplement an ongoing speaker series\nA recurring speaker series that aims to highlight all aspects of a diverse workforce inside the company and outside can prove pivotal. By tapping external speakers to share their expertise, businesses can equip their employees with a variety of insights into how true DEI could be embraced and enhanced internally.\nLead by listening. Maintain an open dialogue with your workforce: Who do they want to hear from? What are they interested in learning? What style do they find most engaging?\nIdentify speakers who are the most relatable and genuine. They don\u2019t have to be famous authors or renowned experts and influencers \u2014 they can often be employees themselves. The storytellers who employees can relate to will be the ones who resonate.\nTo ensure the long-term success of a productive speaker series, in addition to delivering impactful content, the momentum gained from these discussions must be sustained over time. This can be achieved through the use of a Q&A live chat during the meeting, an anonymous submission/recommendation portal, or a short one- or two-question attendee survey following each speaker presentation.\nDefine your commitment\nPrioritizing DEI internally allows businesses to bring together an expansive network of unique individuals with one common goal: Creating positive customer experiences that lead to lasting change. Guide and encourage the program\u2019s evolution by developing a well-defined corporate charter.\nThis ongoing commitment should feature regular and open lines of communication across the organization that welcome continual feedback and employee input. It could also include a closed-loop program evaluation to measure progress.\nTo demonstrate that the feedback is being absorbed and influencing program direction, updates from leadership should be provided at a regular cadence \u2014 quarterly, for example \u2014 preferably via an engaging medium like video that recaps DEI efforts over the last few months. In tandem with a recurring newsletter, this can consolidate and summarize employee feedback on recent initiatives and outline clear goals for the upcoming quarter.\nIn every industry, each interaction between a brand and an individual either reshapes or reaffirms the status quo. Cultivating a hub of diverse people and experiences can help you more successfully curate the best and most innovative ideas for solving customer pain points and reaching business objectives.\nDiversity of thinking can enhance creativity and innovation by 20%, according to Deloitte. A positive, accessible and inclusive interaction between the consumer and the customer service representative is a pivotal \u2014 yet often overlooked \u2014 element in creating a more diverse, equitable and inclusive world.\nThe companies that deliver the best customer experiences not only leverage today\u2019s most advanced technologies to enhance consumer engagement, they also tap into the empathy powered by the human element.\nBy listening to their people to pinpoint issues and solutions that matter, forging strong connections and trust, and fostering an inclusive and respectful work environment, enterprises are able to deliver positive, lasting change across the industries and communities they serve."}

For example, Alorica receives customer satisfaction data for 100% of interactions through Zacoustic\u2019s calibration system.

We implemented an innovative learning analytics solution, designed to root out agent\ntraining problems at the source.\nAfter running a pilot program, the results our agents achieved were nothing short of transformative. Download our Cracking the Code: A Learning Analytics Case Study to learn more.\nDATA SCIENCE TO THE RESCUE!\nSpeed-to-proficiency\u2014the time it takes for agents to attain the skills needed to successfully serve their customers\u2014is a driving Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for companies looking to streamline operations. One such company\u2014a worldwide\ntelecom provider\u2014was seeking ways to enhance agent training protocols and improve speed-to-proficiency in one of their most complex billing lines of business.\nTHE CHALLENGE\nTo implement an innovative learning analytics solution\u2014designed to root out agent training problems at the source\nRun a pilot program, the results our agents achieved were nothing short of transformative\nTHE OUTCOME\nEradication of agent struggles\u2014impacting new-hire trainee proficiency\n5% reduction in agent attrition in the first 90 days\n6-day reduction of new-hire training time\n80% knowledge retention after 1 year\nTHE CHALLENGE\nAn Empowered Agent Starts with Better Training. Traditionally, the client\u2019s agent training program was lengthy and costly\u2014not to mention that agents weren\u2019t consistently retaining all of the needed\ninformation to resolve customer billing inquiries. Enter Alorica. Our Training and Quality teams took a look at the situation and asked\u2014how can we shorten the training process, while still helping agents retain knowledge? Faster and better\u2014it\u2019s\nnot an easy code to crack! But then again, they don\u2019t call us for the easy ones.\nTHE SOLUTION\nA New Platform for Challenging the Status Quo. Our teams uncovered opportunities for improving agent knowledge retention and decreasing \u2018confidently-held misinformation\u2019 by using an industry-leading learning analytics technology\nplatform. The platform revealed that through a multi-week training and nesting period, confidently-held misinformation could be reduced through more streamlined training modules. In turn, this resulted in enhanced knowledge retention, and thus the\nability to better navigate customer billing queries.\nIn short, we were able to identify a problem the client didn\u2019t even know they had\u2014and then offer a solution that would totally change the game.\nTHE OUTCOME\nWe\u2019re just Getting Started. Our pilot program was so successful, the client is looking into adopting it for other areas of their business. Furthermore, we received resoundingly positive feedback from agents, who appreciated a novel, innovative\nand interesting approach to their training.\nOverall, the client achieved faster speed-toproficiency, observed a decrease in risk and loss, and realized enhanced agent engagement and satisfaction\u2014all of which led to happier agents, happier customers and a happier client.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

To differentiate from competitors and provide exceptional customer service,\nbusinesses need to transform the customer experience\u2014but doing so requires data-driven insight into which processes are working and which are not.\u00a0 \u00a0 Customer experience analytics can provide these types of insights and drive positive transformation. The challenge, however, is not just in collecting the right type of data but knowing how to pull insight from it. What data points are important? Which\nare not?\nDetermining the Type of Data You Need and Where to Find It\nContact centers, where agents interact directly with customers, provide a gold mine of customer intelligence. Each interaction is an opportunity to learn more about consumers in order to improve the customer experience. Typically, there are three types\nof data you should collect:\nVolume Data \u2013 Contact events are signs that something isn\u2019t easy for customers to solve on their own. Knowing why customers contact you, by what channels, and with what frequency is key to understanding what the customer\nwants and where the stumbling blocks are. Look at average handle times, rates of repeat contacts, escalations and transfers to determine where there are breakdowns in the contact experience \u2013 these are the elements that may be negatively\nimpacting your customers and your business.Behavioral and Emotional Data \u2013 This type of data measures how your agents handle each customer and how customers respond to the interaction. The data collected should include attributes such as communication and interaction\nskills, compliance, and product and procedural knowledge.Outcome Data \u2013 It\u2019s important to be able to predict and replicate success. Outcome data tells you how frequently you are successful in meeting your business objectives once the interaction is over. For example, completing\na sale, avoiding a cancel or gaining a high customer satisfaction rating are all positive outcomes you want to replicate.\nIt is also critical that your data captures interactions that occur across all channels, so you can connect the pieces of the journey and understand which events trigger or prevent others.\nFinding Insights within the Data\nNow that you have collected a substantial amount of customer experience data, let\u2019s discuss how to use analytics to find insights and improve the customer experience. Check out the below categories to consider when you\u2019re looking to shake\nup the status quo.\nAnomalies \u2013 Look at places where the result deviates from the norm. These statistical anomalies can identify areas of potential breakage in the customer experience.Confluence \u2013 Identify where trends, such as economic and social (e.g., consumer spending habits and mobility trends), intersect with each other. The confluence of these trends can reveal new insights or opportunities.Frustrations \u2013 Processes that result in poor outcomes, higher escalation rates or frequent complaints from frontline employees can pinpoint areas where resolution may be cumbersome or ineffective.Orthodoxies \u2013 Question any beliefs or assumptions that are not supported by correlative data. \u201cHow it has always been done\u201d is not always the most effective way, nor is it the most forward-thinking approach.Extremities \u2013 Look at your outliers. Observing contacts with strongly positive outcome data compared with those in similar situations with strongly negative outcome data can help you determine what differentiates a poor outcome\nfrom a positive one.Voyages \u2013 Allow the data to build a history or timeline that you can replicate and immerse yourself in. From here, you\u2019ll be able to glean contextual insights that help you understand which sequences of events culminate\nin positive or negative outcomes.Analogies \u2013 What you borrow or learn from the patterns and benchmarks of your competitors and other companies can enlighten your own business processes.The discoveries you make from your customer experience analytics can inform how you coach and develop your employees, how you program your interactive voice response, what tools you use and how you evaluate and reward your employees and customers.\nApplying Insights to Drive CX Transformation\nTo effectively apply the insights gleaned from the data to create transformation, you must make it digestible and actionable for those who have the ability to make change or alter course based on the findings. This effort requires collaboration and coordination\nacross departments. It should make the translation from \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d to \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d, so the cross-functional team can determine what to do about it.\nWhen presented in these terms, the insights allow customer experience executives to not only clearly define what is going wrong (or right), but also to quantify the costs of problems\u2014and any required solutions. In this way, business decisions become\neasier to make and to justify, and thereby speed up the transformation process and allow your business to remain competitive.\nFor more information on how to use customer experience data to drive transformation,\u00a0download the eBook now.SOURCES\n1 \u00a0https://alorica.com/insight/thats-what-she-said/\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc_454", "title": "Don't Diss Disruptive Tech", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/dont-diss-disruptive-tech\nDon't Diss Disruptive Tech\nShare this\nDon't diss disruptive tech - because it's here to stay, and it's awesome!\nDownload our overview to learn more about how we're finding sensational new ways to keep making lives better\u2026one interaction at a time with new and insanely great technologies. At Alorica, we\u2019re all about using disruptive using technologies\nin our day-to-day operations. Read on to learn more about some (but not all!) of the tools we\u2019re using to change the game\u2014and the results we\u2019ve seen so far. \u00a0MICROLEARNING  80% of our new hires are millennials\u2014and given their average 90-second attention span, we\u2019ve needed to develop training that is easily digestible and visually engaging. We call this new approach microlearning\u2014short, interactive, 2-10\nminute videos that deliver information \u201cjust in time\u201d\u2014right before the lessons are applied. Typically more effective than traditional \u201cjust in case\u201d classroom learning, Microlearning videos are quick, to-the-point, and\nhelp reduce the need for agents to sit in long, 8-hour PowerPoint classroom training sessions.\nIn action: Microlearning reduced training time by as much as 80% for agents serving a major retail pharmacy provider (and retained up to 20% more information than traditional comparative training classes)\u2014leading to significant\ncost savings for the client.\nGAMIFICATION\nTurning non-game experiences (like providing customer care) into fun, competitive events that motivate, encourage and reinforce learning\u2014 that\u2019s gamification. Through it, employees can interact with a game-like platform to evaluate their performance,\nsee how they stack up against other agents, and earn points that are redeemable for rewards.\nWe customize our systems to each client\u2019s individual objective, and drive agent effort from \u201cacceptable\u201d to \u201coptimal\u201d performanc with game played and reward earned.\nIn action: Businesses who use gamification platforms tend to see positive results with agent performance, attrition, absenteeism and overall satisfaction. It\u2019s simple\u2014engaged employees, who receive a boost in recognition and\nincentives, perform better.\nROBOTIC DESKTOP AUTOMATION (RDA)/ ROBOTIC PROCESS AUTOMATION (RPA)\nMovies may depict robots as the future enslavers of humanity, but they\u2019re actually pretty darn useful when trying to solve issues faster, reduce performance variability and make the interaction between agent and customer a little more pleasant.\nThere are two types of robotic automation; RDA consolidates content from different desktop screens into one singular view, allowing agents to more easily respond to customer requests in realtime. RPA is all about workflow computerization, and\nthese robots identify manual, repetitive and rules-based processes\u2014tackling them in a fraction of the time that it would take an agent, and with complete accuracy.\nIn action: For a major energy company, robotic automation reduced average handle time (AHT) by 10%, and error rates improved to near perfect. For a major telecommunications firm, robots saved the company over $18M per year by allowing\nhundreds of agents to focus on more complex tasks \u00a0DON\u2019T DISS DISRUPTIVE TECH BECAUSE IT\u2019S HERE TO STAY \u2014AND IT\u2019S AWESOME!CHATBOTS\nJob-seekers are active on social media and other non-traditional channels, and we\u2019re implementing chatbot technology as a smarter, faster way to connect with qualified candidates. Thanks to their automated nature, chatbots can handle simultaneous\ncandidate inquiries, provide real-time responses and conduct initial applicant screenings. And because they operate 24/7, we\u2019ve seen a significant increase in the number of quality candidates we assess and ultimately hire.In-action: In three months\u2019 time, we were able to interview approximately 3,000 candidates, compared to 966 during the same time-frame without chatbots\u2014saving over 1,200 recruiting man-hours and reducing the cost-per-hire\nby 84%.SPEECH ANALYTICS\nThis new tool is leading to all kinds of \u2018a-ha!\u2019 moments. Through Speech Analytics, we can determine what we are primarily talking to customers about and glean targeted information. Are customers calling about billing? Technology? Something\nelse? How did the call go? Was it a good customer experience? What could we be doing better?\nIn-action: Speech Analytics radically enhances our Quality Assurance model through technology. It allows us to better support our clients and offer new and better capabilities, identify call trends and themes, and help us create even\nmore insanely great customer experiences.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc_456", "title": "Lessons in Loyalty", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/lessons-in-loyalty\nLessons in Loyalty\nShare this\nWhile conducting research for this blog, it was surprising to find that the majority of what has been written about loyalty programs revolves around how they can be most effectively implemented to drive sales and retention. This makes sense from the perspective\nthat loyalty programs are, at their core, focused on driving revenue, but the lack of attention to how these programs can impact the customer experience is astonishing.\nA recent study on retail brands found that 79% of respondents left a brand due to a poor customer experience.1\u00a0That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to keep sight of the potential negative impact that a loyalty program may have on the\ncustomer experience. Establishing a program to drive retention and sales that may actually be driving customers away defeats the purpose of having a loyalty program in the first place! A good starting point when considering the customer experience\nis the effort required of the customer to interact with a brand. For loyalty programs, this takes the form of earning and utilizing the benefits.\nConsider the following three recommendations to establish and monitor an easy-to-use (and easy-to-understand) loyalty program that not only drives sales and retention but also protects the customer experience:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keep it simple and clear\nAccording to the Harvard Business Review, reducing customer effort is an important part of building loyalty,2\u00a0and Alorica recently expanded on this in our essential to create a rewards program that is easy to understand and use. To do\nthis, keep these points in mind:\nSimple points system\nThe most common loyalty program methodology is a system where frequent members earn points that translate into some type of reward, and members work toward a certain amount of points to redeem their reward. The key here is to ensure that the relationship\nbetween points and tangible rewards is not complex and confusing.\nOne way to maintain clarity is to have a system in which every dollar spent equals a set amount of points, the easiest being a 1:1 ratio. However, this system typically works best for businesses that encourage frequent short-term purchases.3\nSet a clear goal, and make it easy to see progress\nTo prevent customer confusion around a loyalty program, customers must look forward to a clear-cut goal with a finish line (or multiple finish lines) to cross or else they\u2019ll lose interest.4\nA major US hotel chain recently experienced high contact volume of customers who were unsure of their rewards point balance, and wanted to understand the current balance and progress toward their goal. Providing customers with clear and easily accessible\nmethods to discover this information is paramount to reducing customer effort.\nA recent JD & Associates study found that IHG Rewards and Fairmont President\u2019s Club were at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of customer satisfaction with their respective rewards programs.5\u00a0Looking at their mobile apps\nand how points progress is displayed on each may help explain why Hilton is a leader while Fairmont lags behind.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitor and control\nAn excellent indicator that your loyalty program requires too much effort is when customers are not using it! A program to continuously monitor engagement on your loyalty program not only facilitates retention but can also help ascertain whether your\ncustomers feel that the program is too obtuse.\nRedemption rate (total points redeemed on rewards/total points issued to customers) is one way to measure customer engagement; industry-leading loyalty programs boast a redemption rate of 20%, and the average program sees 14% of points turned into a reward.6\u00a0If\na redemption rate falls below 14%, it may be time to review customer feedback to determine opportunities for improvement.\nGathering customer feedback on your loyalty program is the second component of monitoring and controlling your loyalty program. Instead of waiting until there is a problem to seek feedback from program members, gather info continuously to ensure that\nthe organization has a finger on the pulse of the customer. This data be used when redemption rate dips and also allows an organization to be proactive in reducing effort.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use data for continuous improvement\nLoyalty programs generate countless data points on consumer habits, such as average transaction amount, most frequently purchased items, and much more.7\u00a0This data, combined with customer contact history, provides organizations with the\nammunition needed to proactively prevent future contacts on purchases. If a customer purchased a product and experienced an issue, chances are that they may experience a similar issue with a similar product. Smart businesses will use this data in\nconcert to push proactive content to customers to reduce the likelihood of a future contact.\nPretty simple, right? Create a program that is easy to understand and use, measure its effectiveness, and use the data available to continuously improve your customers\u2019 experience. Seem daunting? If so, we\u2019re here to help!\nAt Alorica, we are insanely passionate about creating effortless customer experiences, and we would be happy to partner with you to unearth opportunities that drive customer retention while maintaining an amazing customer experience.

Discover How Alorica is Unlocking This Opportunity\u2026", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/does-generative-ai-hold-the-key-to-modern-cx-discover-how-alorica-is-unlocking-this-opportunity\nDoes Generative AI Hold the Key to Modern CX? Discover How Alorica is Unlocking This Opportunity\u2026\nAuthored By: Harry Folloder, Alorica\u2019s Chief Digital Officer\nShare this\nGenerative AI is revolutionizing the adoption of artificial intelligence by making it more accessible to a wider audience, with products like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard leading the charge. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT set a new record for the fastest-growing consumer application in history when it reached 100 million monthly active users just two months after its launch. As a global provider of customer experience (CX) solutions, Alorica is already harnessing the power of generative AI to create more personalized brand interactions.In today\u2019s competitive business environment, every interaction is crucial for brands to meet their customers\u2019 needs. To deliver a positive customer experience, it's essential to understand intent, context, and sentiment to provide a proactive and helpful response that is customized and delivered quickly. As a Large Learning Model (LLM), generative AI is often used to perform Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks with the unique ability to be trained on large datasets. By seamlessly integrating the intricacies of human language with comprehension of massive content repositories, the promise that lies ahead is more meaningful and relevant responses that underpin chatbots, virtual assistants and other AI-driven language applications in a powerful way.As an LLM, generative AI is a game-changing resource for contact centers delivering CX. Its conversation-generating attribute makes it an incredibly versatile tool that can power self-service bots, automate email responders, and produce report summarizations. While automated chat responses already help brands handle basic queries and perform simple tasks, generative AI adds value in other areas, including in-depth analysis of customer interactions. Service organizations can use it to streamline customer service interactions quickly, easily, and accurately, saving significant time and resources. It also enables brands to gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and pain points, using this information to adapt their products, services, and processes.One of the overlooked benefits of generative AI is that it allows enterprises to leverage more unstructured data, such as conversations, chat interactions, and even operating manuals, which is a significant leap forward. This means that previously \"dark data\" can now be resurrected in a meaningful way, providing organizations with valuable intel that they were unable to access before.Alorica has taken the lead in developing and assessing the potential of generative AI to enhance customer satisfaction and lifetime value.For example, Alorica is collaborating with Microsoft and OpenAI on several proof of concepts. Through this partnership, Alorica is using ChatGPT to analyze millions of customer surveys on behalf of a major telecommunications client. The purpose of this initiative is to identify patterns and trends that will enable Alorica and its client to derive actionable insights with exponentially more speed, agility, scalability, consistency, and efficiency.By combining ChatGPT\u2019s analytics and knowledge management capabilities with Alorica\u2019s digital-first approach to servicing over 2 billion customer interactions annually, the goal is to establish use cases and applications that will transform CX. Its first task is to analyze 50,000 data assets from five years and produce a cohesive report in record time. ChatGPT is scanning and analyzing every document and synthesizing all the data within a short period so that companies can take specific actions accordingly. This project will uncover every \u201cvoice of the customer\u201d more rapidly, precisely, and comprehensively.Generative AI is not just a flashy new toy. It represents a breakthrough in natural language processing technology that promises to significantly change how businesses access information and evolve. The dawn of a new era in CX technology and engagement is upon us, and as an industry, we\u2019ve only just scratched the surface. For this reason (and more), Alorica is eager to be at the forefront, harnessing the power of generative AI in its early stages and deploying the tool to help define the next generation of customer experience.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc_464", "title": "How to Automate Your Contact Center Without Leaving Your Employees Behind", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/how-to-automate-your-contact-center-without-leaving-your-employees-behind\nHow to Automate Your Contact Center Without Leaving Your Employees Behind\nShare this\nThere\u2019s no arguing that automation of low-skill tasks in contact centers is a trend that is gaining momentum and a strategy that\u2019s important to explore. But, it\u2019s also important to remember that your agents need to be on board with this strategy too. In a market defined by record low unemployment and high competition for talent, retaining key agents can be a competitive advantage. Don\u2019t let your move to automation drive up attrition and take away that advantage.\nInstead, adopt a lesson from industry leaders experienced in deploying self-service strategies and earn the support of your staff before you conceptualize\u00a0what\u00a0you will be automating. That\u2019s done by tuning into the\u00a0why\u00a0and\u00a0how\u00a0of the automation journey.\n1. Make employees part of the why.Employee engagement is paramount to any business transformation effort. Transparency is key. The real magic is in translating your why into something your front line can grab onto and promote alongside you.\nOne of the primary reason\u2019s employees leave a company is because they don\u2019t feel valued or challenged.1\u00a0A strong foundation is built when employees not only feel valued for their skills, but also for their ability to communicate well, focus on the real issues requiring complex problem solving, and maintain a high degree of emotional intelligence along the way. Anyone can reset a password or check an order status. It takes true moxie to resolve an in-depth challenge facing a customer and transform their experience into a game changer. Employees should understand that a move to automation is not meant to replace them. Instead, it\u2019s meant to create more opportunities for them to focus on more complex issues and use their communication and problem-solving skills to the fullest.\n2. Answer \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201dEmployees want to know what\u2019s in it for them, especially as fears arise about what automation means for future job security. Make them part of the process by adopting a hands-on approach. Closed-loop employee input is a great way to involve employees and gain excitement early in the self-service adoption process.\nMake ongoing conversations with employees a priority to learn what challenges recur daily and what prevents true resolution.2\u00a0Ask what could be automated to improve the customer experience and improve focus on the more complex issues. Often times, the largest systemic flaws are identified in these meetings. You\u2019ll walk away with a gold mine of information and employees will feel valued, trusted and, most importantly, heard.\nFact check the feedback against repeat calls, resolution rates, NPS\u00ae scores and CSAT scores to demonstrate the ROI for the investments needed to correct the issue. Then go forth to develop your action plan. Don\u2019t forget to close the loop \u2013 use your regular meetings to share your action plan and progress, ensuring it is understandable to those it will impact the most.\n3. Create a passion for self-service.Keep employees excited about a self-service culture by cultivating a campaign and infrastructure with them in mind. A few easy checks will ensure you\u2019re doing just that.\nAre you including hands-on classroom training on new applications, with skills verification and proficiency checks?What is your strategy for ongoing training when your website, app or other self-service tools are updated? Have you invested in a mobile learning lab?Are your contact center goals aligned with the move to self-service?\u00a0How are you rewarding and recognizing employees for use and promotion of self-service channels?When employees understand\u00a0why\u00a0and\u00a0how\u00a0a process like automation makes both their lives and the customers\u2019 lives easier, they will be more likely to not only to adopt, but to promote it. Following these key guidelines to involve employees in the early phases of your journey toward automation will help increase your chances of success as you adopt a self-service strategy that will transform your business.\nSOURCES\nhttps://www.breathehr.com/blog/what-are-the-main-causes-of-employee-turnoverhttps://www.officevibe.com/blog/connecting-with-employees\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc_465", "title": "Taking a Bite Out of Churn, One Customer at a Time", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/taking-a-bite-out-of-churn-one-customer-at-a-time\nTaking a Bite Out of Churn, One Customer at a Time\nShare this\nAs customers become more empowered to select goods and services that fit best into their lifestyle, it is imperative that businesses work harder to retain the customers they have. The cost of attracting new customers continues to increase, making it harder\nto grow business profitably without a steady base of loyal customers. It\u2019s widely understood that it is more expensive to attract a new customer than it is to retain an existing one\u20145x more!\u2014depending on the\u00a0source1\u00a0and\nindustry.\u00a0This principle of customer loyalty is referred to as the Net Promoter Score\u00ae movement.\nSo, we know that giving customers incentives to stay is the key to retention. But how do you do that in such a competitive environment?\nLet\u2019s break it down, shall we?\nListen to your customers\u2019 needs\nTake the time to know your customers\u2014really\u00a0know them. Who are they? What do they really want? Ask simple and pointed questions to get to the root of understanding their desires, what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t, and how they feel\nabout their current service delivery. This can be accomplished through email surveys, phone marketing, exit interviews or by proactively monitoring social media and online customer forums.\nAct on the data you gather\nChange when change is called for and adapt your business to accommodate the customers you serve. Tailor your support structure and offerings based on their feedback. Let your customers know you heard them. Provide alternative solutions where known issues\nexist. Proactively offer something (a discount, promo item, etc.) to acknowledge those who take the time to provide feedback. Furthermore, it\u2019s important to offer an array of methods to receive feedback\u2014options should include human interaction\n(phone or chat) and self-help (IVR, web or social). It\u2019s your willingness and ability to connect with your customers and address their needs that will increase their likelihood of staying satisfied longer\u2014which directly impacts your ability\nto retain and grow your market share.\nRespect your customers\u2019 time\nEach interaction you have with your customers should be natural, organic and personalized. Customers can sense scripted pitches and checklists, and they are more likely to respond positively to a real person than a script. Keep in mind that a captive\naudience is not necessarily the most appropriate opportunity to sell. Listen and act to resolve customers\u2019 needs\u00a0first\u00a0so they feel valued. Build trust and rapport\u2014explain what you can and will do each step of the way.\nAsk questions to uncover how they use your product or service and identify opportunities to educate them on how to get the most out of it going forward. Once you confirm their needs are met and thank them for their business, let them get on with their\nday. Respecting their time makes them feel appreciated. Conversely, over-solicitation of new offerings that don\u2019t fit their needs could push them to a competitor.\nStay relevant\nIt hardly needs to be said (but we\u2019re going to say it anyway)\u2014it\u2019s\u00a0absolutely\u00a0critical\u00a0to understand your customers and your competition. The marketplace is constantly changing,\nand what customers see, and experience elsewhere sets the bar for their expectations. Keeping pace with the market will help prevent customers from perceiving that there is something better out there. As new offers or solutions become available, be\nsure to enable your frontline to articulate the differences and/or provide counter offers to align with the perceived value of competitive products. Being agile in the face of market disruption will help you avoid the fate of once\u00a0iconic brands2\u00a0no\nlonger in existence.\nSo, let\u2019s sum it up. To reduce costly customer churn, the key is to stay focused on and connected with the customers you have, listen and adapt to their feedback, respect their time and ensure your offers and solutions are competitively relevant.\nFor help getting started, or for a more in-depth review of customer experience best practices, contact Alorica today.\nSOURCES\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2018/09/12/dont-spend-5-times-more-attracting-new-customers-nurture-the-existing-ones/#507c4acd5a8e\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101215/7-iconic-brands-no-longer-exist.asp\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

The key to being a lifelong learner is to also be a lifelong\nlistener. If you\u2019re able to really listen, you can focus on objectives and not be paralyzed by the status quo. Working her way up in the BPO industry, she started out as an agent and then was a team manager and an operations manager. She also worked as a trainer and in performance engineering before she moved into client solutions. Each new opportunity was a result\nof learning as much as she could in every role, and then pursuing the next challenge. Read her full Q&A below:Q: How have mentors made a difference in your career?A: My first office job was during college and involved filing papers. My boss was the comptroller, and he went above and\nbeyond teaching me about the business, which reinforced my hunger for lifelong learning. I ended up leading their accounting team! Since then, he has been a source of inspiration in mentoring my own teams. Whether someone reports to me or I work with\nthem, I want to be a positive influence in their lives and in their careers.\nQ: Looking back, did you see yourself reaching a director role?A: Yes, I did see myself in this role. I always had a path forward, but I think in life, your priorities change\nas you grow. When my daughter was 3, I decided to leave the workforce for a year and a half. I did it for her, and what I gained was tremendous. That time away improved me in many ways--my patience grew, my perspectives widened, my leadership and\nlistening skills improved, and my priorities about life changed.Q: As a leader, have you experienced a challenge that felt particular to being a woman? If so, how did you handle it, and what did you learn?A: In my life and career, I\u2019ve\nhad to overcome the challenge of perspective whether it\u2019s because I\u2019m female, a minority, my age, or all of the above. Respect is earned, and it can be earned pretty quickly. Know your business, use effective communication, and make fact-based\nrecommendations. This all leads to credibility and respect.Q: Would you change anything in your career trajectory? Why or why not?A: I\u2019ve made mistakes, I\u2019ve suffered heartaches, I\u2019ve fought hard and lost battles,\nbut I can\u2019t say I regret any of it. Every one of those things have been a learning experience, building character and tenacity. The fact that I have been in so many roles and have had the chance to look at the business from varied perspectives\nhas been positive and has let me make better decisions.Q: What excites you most about what you do at Alorica?A: Technology is progressing to take over tedious activities that allow people to spend their time in areas that provide\nmore value, and to think of solutions for the future. It\u2019s exciting, and absolutely a challenge. What\u2019s more enriching? Something that comes easily, or something that you have to work hard to achieve?\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

All was going smoothly, but two weeks prior to the end of new-hire training, the scope of work shifted. Alorica was\ntasked to focus instead on troubleshooting and technical support, in order to help reduce unnecessary service dispatches. And then, one week after the launch, the scope increased to include upselling of ancillary products/services.\nGood thing we\u2019re all about overcoming adversity\nTHE SOLUTION\nSometimes, You Need Reinforcements.\nChanges to the scope required us to make significant investments in additional coaching and leadership resources.\n\u2022 Sales-After-Service Coaches who specialize in Alorica\u2019s solutions-based selling methodology were assigned to assist agents with selling on service calls.\n\u2022 Business Intelligence Analysts were hired to review call recordings and compare time spent in the interactive troubleshooting guide, pages visited, and systems accessed for specific calls that resulted in non-qualified tech dispatch; the findings\nwere forwarded with suggested coaching methods to reduce the number of costly and unnecessary service dispatches.\n\u2022 Voice of the Customer Coaches specializing in VOC solutions for detractors were assigned to work with agents having challenges with specific customer dissatisfaction categories\nAnd Sometimes, You Need Added Bench Strength.\nIt was critical to ensure that growth did not come at the expense of performance, so Alorica made bench strength investments by enhancing Leadership Development and Succession Planning.\n\u2022 Early leadership assessments of all agents helped workforce planning understand the potential bench strength available for ramps\n\u2022 Financial incentives encouraged agents to enroll in Alorica\u2019s \u201cclear path\u201d program for leadership development and leadership certifications\n\u2022 Systematic succession planning established that managers would be eligible for promotion only when at least two of their subordinates were certified for promotion\n\u2022 Peer-to-Peer \u201cBuddy System\u201d was founded, where each role, function and manager were paired up with a high-performing manager within the client\u2019s internal contact centers\nAlorica drove ticket quality and ultimately minimized the expense of dispatching to the client\u2019s customers who truly required a service truck, by implementing a Ticket Quality Management group.\n\u2022 We hired Ticket Quality Managers as business intelligence analysts to audit calls and systems, identify outliers and coach for improvements for non-qualified dispatches\nPre-dispatch auditing identified Non-Qualified Dispatches prior to our client incurring the expense, by reviewing call recordings and comparing time spent in the interactive troubleshooting guide, pages visited, and systems accessed for\nspecific calls that resulted in non-qualified tech dispatch\nOutlier identification of the individual team (and site where the non-qualified dispatch originated) was gathered and analyzed\nOutlier coaching was conducted to improve behaviors and avoid future non-qualified dispatches\nTHE OUTCOME\nBeing Nimble and Staying Committed\u2014That\u2019s how We Earn a Win.\nThe ability to react quickly to change played a major part in finding success with (and for) our client. Thanks to significant investment in additional coaching and leadership resources, our partnership with the client helped to:\n\u2022 Exceed performance targets during and after launch\n\u2022 Drive improvements to service ticket quality\n\u2022 Minimize the expense of dispatching to customers \u2026talk about an insanely great ending.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc_476", "title": "Social Care, Analytics and the Retail Customer Experience", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/social-care-analytics-and-the-retail-customer-experience\nSocial Care, Analytics and the Retail Customer Experience\nShare this\n\u201cKnow your customer\u201d has been a retail rallying cry for the past several decades. As businesses continue to evaluate and segment data to understand their customers\u2019 likely buying behaviors, they are rapidly replacing existing and outmoded product-centric programs with strategies focused on improving customer experience. The challenge retailers now face is how to enhance and personalize the customer experience, so as to generate an emotional bond between the consumer and the brand\u2014regardless of the communication channels employed throughout the relationship.\nBut let\u2019s step back for a moment and discuss the sweeping technological phenomena known as Social Media. What began as a way for people to stay connected has evolved into the dominant platform for information gathering. It has overthrown TV, radio and print as the preferred media source for a growing percentage of the population, and as \u2018cord cutters\u2019 continue to rise, advertising dollars are shifting away from cable and satellite services, and are being reallocated towards content consumption on increasingly sophisticated smart devices.\nAs these extensive technological changes continue, and growing consumer demand and the ever-increasing number of web-based communication platforms push e-commerce to center stage, it\u2019s imperative not to lose sight of drivers and indicators of buying behavior; this is particularly critical for Millennial and Generation Z consumers. Incorporating an intelligent social learning analytics platform into your existing CRM workflow (either on your own or through a customer care service provider) can help unlock valuable consumer data, including which social connections are most influential in their purchasing decisions. Insights from these analytics enable retailers to better know their customers and improve their experiences, and these insights also enable content providers to refine their products and to make smarter decisions based on customer preference. The emerging area of social care\u2014the efforts of caring for customers using social media\u2014is becoming a reality of day-to-day business operations for retailers. Marketers, retailers and marketplace merchants recognize the tremendous opportunity to enhance their customer journey by providing social media support, yet many struggle to prove the qualitative and quantitative value of their efforts.\nRetailers are being pushed into social care by engaged, social-savvy consumers who are posting questions of the retailers on social networks. The magnitude of these communications can seem overwhelming, with many companies struggling to successfully manage the volume of inquiries. The good news, is that not all social posts are created equal\u2014they don\u2019t all require a response. Robust listening platforms along with strategies to prioritize posts can make responding to social media communications manageable and effective.\u00a0In addition, while the goal is to serve customers in the channel of original contact, channel redirection will likely remain an issue for many retailers. Channel redirection occurs when a customer asks a question in a channel that isn\u2019t able to support an appropriate response. For example, if a customer asks a question on Twitter, the retailer may not be able to sufficiently address the inquiry in 140 characters or less. For some context, the previous sentence contains 146 characters. Likewise, a customer may need to share sensitive account information, thus requiring a more private, secure channel such as phone, chat or email.\nAlthough channel redirection ensures that customer questions are answered, it raises problems for measuring performance and customer satisfaction levels. But fear not! Fortunately, there are technology platforms for social customer care that are quickly evolving to address these issues.\nMetrics are an essential component when evaluating the effectiveness of a social care program. Traditional social media metrics (\u201clikes\u201d, \u201cfollowers,\u201d etc.) are valuable, but they don\u2019t necessarily provide insight into important areas\u2014like the level of customer satisfaction across multiple channels when channel redirection occurs. Both quantitative and qualitative metrics are important elements in a balanced social care effectiveness overview. Bringing this continually maturing channel into the framework of your support center will help solidify it as a valuable component of your customer retention strategy.\nLastly, consider partnering with your user community. It\u2019s a good idea to deploy YouTube customer support responses and developing guided self-help solutions to some of your most frequently asked questions (FAQs) when possible. As the second most-used search engine by Generation Z, YouTube can help you provide a concierge-level experience to a savvy consumer while reducing your company\u2019s overall support cost. Avenues for guided self-service, including video FAQs and tutorials, provide a path of great value for your users while allowing agents to focus on more involved user requests. This nets you a win/win outcome\u2014higher satisfaction levels for all customers, and a more strategic deployment of internal resources\u2014both of which can impact your bottom and top lines.\nToday\u2019s retailers stand at a crossroads\u2014evolve existing practices to meet and exceed the expectations of your customers, or stand by as your competition makes these changes and outperforms you in the marketplace. Don\u2019t let customers pass you by\u2014start planning your social care, channel redirection and guided self-service strategy today\u2014because your success depends on it!\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

The ability to get information\nquickly without leaving the keyboard is a key benefit; of those who utilize Live Chat, 79% do so because of the efficient nature of the platform.2\nIn fact, chat has the highest satisfaction rating among all customer service channels, with\u00a073% of online consumers giving it the thumbs up.3\u00a0Why\nso beloved? Here are four great reasons why customers embrace this customer service channel.\n#1: More convenient than drive-thru coffee\nAverage customer wait times are generally much shorter in live chat than when calling in to a support line, and customers can multitask while waiting for a response. The average response time is 2 minutes and 40 seconds, with the fastest response time being 7 seconds4\u2014compared\nto nearly 7 minutes of wait time when calling in to a contact center.5#2: More connected than an Instagram Influencer\nCustomer service reps using Live Chat can co-browse (view a customer\u2019s screen); this lets them see in real-time what they need to in order to troubleshoot the customer\u2019s online issues with speed and efficiency.6#3: More accurate than a laser-guided missileLive chat makes it easy for agents and customers to share SKU numbers, general account information, confirmation codes and other important textual data\u2014reducing the likelihood of errors.\n#4: More proactive than a devoted butlerLive Chat lets agents serve up special offers to loyal customers or offer assistance; meanwhile a live preview of what the customer is typing provides agents with in-depth insights\u2014before the customer has even finished typing!6\u00a0Research shows that customers are as equally receptive to chat as a marketing tool as they are to use it for online support, and chat has been shown to drive customer loyalty. Consider these facts:\n44% of online consumers7\u00a0say that having questions answered\nby a live person while in the middle of an online purchase is one of the most important features a website can offer.79% of customers say they prefer live chat purely because of\u00a0the immediacy it offers\u00a0compared to other channels.863% of consumers say9\u00a0they are\u00a0more likely to make another purchase from a website that offers live chat.Live chat offers several benefits to e-commerce businesses and other companies. Online support tools enable the capture of valuable consumer data\u2014such as last page viewed and common questions\u2014that can reveal opportunities to improve the user\nexperience. In addition, agents\u2019 ability to handle multiple conversations simultaneously can reduce average interaction costs. Equally important, offering live chat can increase conversion rates and reduce abandonment, since 77% of customers won\u2019t make a purchase on a website if there\u2019s no live chat option available.10\nChat is increasingly relevant and valuable as a support and sales channel; not only does it enhance the customer journey (leading to increased efficiencies and streamlined handling), it provides an opportunity to maximize the customer experience by engaging visitors who might\u00a0otherwise have left your website without making a purchase or ever asking for help.\nAnd that\u2019s something worth talking about.\nSOURCEShttps://smallbiztrends.com/2018/01/live-chat-statistics.htmlhttps://www.revechat.com/blog/9-essential-live-chat-statistics-need-consider/https://www.invespcro.com/blog/live-chat-customer-support/https://www.nextiva.com/blog/what-is-live-chat.htmlhttps://www.talkdesk.com/blog/how-long-do-callers-wait-before-they-hang-up/https://www.customerservicemanager.com/how-does-live-chat-increase-efficiency-while-reducing-costs/https://www.inc.com/nicolas-cole/the-power-of-live-chat-5-surprising-statistics-that-show-how-consumers-want-thei.htmlhttps://www.revechat.com/blog/9-essential-live-chat-statistics-need-consider/https://neilpatel.com/blog/live-chat-marketing/https://www.invespcro.com/blog/live-chat-customer-support/\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

Scott Nebel, Omaha 06\nWhile any fundraising event that engages, unifies and raises money is a worthy effort, fundraising is not without its failures and frustrations. So here is ...\nPart 2 (click here for Part 1):\u00a0What Went Wrong\u2026?\u00a0 (Our Worst 3 Fundraisers)\nFlop Number\u00a03: Car Wash\nHose? Buckets? Soap? Towels? Let's go! Wait, where are the cars? A Car Wash without cars is just a Wash, only we're not really washing anything, so it's more of a \"_\", which I really don't know\nhow to pronounce, but I'm pretty sure a \"_\" doesn't make any money!\nWe have succeeded and failed with car washes, but failure was always a result of\u00a0the planning and execution. To avoid repeating our mistakes:\nTIP 1: Overbook! Always schedule\nmore than enough volunteers. You never know who is going to be sick, be pulled into emergency meetings, or get abducted by aliens (Seriously, it's been weeks. Where's Joe!)\nTIP 2: Promotion! We don't mean promoting a person to Executive Vice President\nof Corporate Suds and Towels, we mean make sure you build up the line of cars in advance. Put up flyers and start taking names a week ahead of time. This also helps you figure out\u00a0how much staff you will need.\nFlop Number 2: Off-Site Events\nOff-Site events after working hours can be a great idea: Getting employees interacting outside of work, getting the name Alorica out into the community\u2014it's a win-win, even if you make\nnothing. It's essentially advertising how much we care about our causes, as well as how much we care about our employees and each other. But ...\nTIP 1: Make it scalable! This part of the planning phase saved us in a recent bowling fundraiser flop.\nWhether we had 10 people show, or 100, we weren't going to lose money. We didn't really make any money either, but that's still marginally in the \"win\" column! (Now to reinvest those six pennies in the Penny War...)\nTIP 2: Again ... Promote it! We're still working out the kinks on cross-program promotion, but ensure you have active engagement\nacross all programs if you are opening an event up to more than one program to participate. A single flyer or email isn't as effective as people on the ground actively promoting it with multiple points of communication. Never underestimate the power of\na full song-and-dance number! Nobody will ever forget that day ... no matter how much I wish they would (Seriously, I probably should have realized you have to be able to sing and dance in a song-and-dance number. Also not really the best time for my\nfirst attempt at a back flip... I swear I'll pay for those damages!)\nNumber 1: Culture Kitchen\n\"Wait, didn't you say Culture Kitchen was one of your BEST ideas?\" \u00a0Yup.\n\"Are you losing your mind, or are you saying this is now your WORST idea?\"\u00a0 Yup.\nPricing\nis a dangerous game of Operation hooked up to a car battery ... One false move and you're on the ceiling picking up radio stations in your fillings! We've been there, and it's no fun dangling from florescent light ballasts. Instead, establish a foolproof\nplan.\nTIP1: I \"math-ed\" and you can, too!\u00a0 Here's the equation we feel leads to our most successful pricing:\n2c/p\naka Two times the Cost of the food, divided by the anticipated number of Participants.\nTIP 2: Perspiration over Participation Anticipation?\u00a0 Worry not! We believe we've cracked that code. Sure we don't have a crystal ball, or a time-traveling Delorian, but we are still holding out hope that a cyborg from the future will come back\nin time to tell us what everyone wants for lunch in 3 weeks. Totally could happen! Until then, we've found that anticipated participation usually comes in around 25-33% of total employees. Don't cook for all of your employees\n(at least not when there is a charge... FREE\u00a0food is a totally different animal, and it's not housebroken, not even a little!)\nYou'll get a feel for what meals are bigger hits as you\ntry some, but in general, 25-33% seems to be the average participation anytime we have a vendor, or become the vendor ourselves. Oh, and always round prices up \u2026 it\u2019s easier to give change for whole dollars!\nTo Avoid Fundraising Failures, Follow our Four \"P\"s:\nPlan it! (Price it and staff it appropriately, then execute the heck out of it!)\nPromote it! (Don't skimp on the flyers, the emails, or the dancing monkeys!)\nParty with it! (Make it Fun! Host it with a smile and make the fundraising a party!)\nPeanut Butter! (Yeah, I really only had three \"P\"s, sorry.)\nFor additional Questions on our Fundraising Successes and Failures, contact us at [email\u00a0protected]\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc_494", "title": "4 Tips to Strengthen IT Customer Service Response", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/4-tips-to-strengthen-it-customer-service-response\n4 Tips to Strengthen IT Customer Service Response\nShare this\nWhile it\u2019s important to deliver consistent client service on a regular basis, it can be difficult to do so without the proper technological infrastructure. As consumer demands continue to shift,\u00a0customer care solutions\u00a0teams are beginning to further rely on new and advanced technical support processes to better meet their patrons\u2019 needs. While these technologies create a faster, more flexible staff member,\nthey also require special attention in some instances, since a breakdown can disrupt the entire infrastructure.\nIT teams can be deployed to fix any internal hiccups in a\u00a0customer relationship management technology\u00a0system, but in terms of systematic processes,\nfinding the root cause to an issue is a different ball game. If a client support team can effectively troubleshoot its problems, they\u2019re more likely to improve upon their consumer satisfaction, among other things. With that in mind, here are\nfour tips for customer service representatives to keep in mind when attempting to troubleshoot a systematic issue:\n1. Don\u2019t jump to conclusions:\u00a0Assuming typically doesn\u2019t get anyone very far, so best practice \u2013 especially in the customer service industry \u2013 is to evaluate the situation from a big picture viewpoint. It\ncan be tempting for a seasoned client representative to jump to a conclusion about something when a customer contacts a business\u2019s service center, especially if the rep at hand has dealt with a similar situation before. However, the idea of\neffective troubleshooting is to find the root cause of the problem and then begin addressing the issue from that point on.\n2. Remain attentive throughout the entire process:\u00a0The parlance of a\u00a0BPO technical support\u00a0representative\nwill likely differ from that of an everyday customer calling in with a question or concern. It\u2019s important for staff members to remain vigilant on the back end so that nothing falls through the cracks. The way a client describes something may\nmake sense to him or her, but it very well could be the wrong way to\u00a0describe something from a business standpoint. Alternatively, a technical support team also needs to play the role of translator when speaking with a patron, otherwise the internal\nvernacular may confuse the customer at hand.\n3. Manage issues in order of their importance:\u00a0In a perfect world, nothing would ever go wrong with a customer service team\u2019s IT infrastructure, therefore eliminating any issues that stem from said hiccups. However, since the\nhuman element is a constant in the client services equation, there are bound to be mistakes in the process. As a result, management needs to teach its team how to prioritize effectively, or else the most important issues won\u2019t get taken care\nof first.\n4. Cover all bases before taking action:\u00a0This can be particularly tricky because the modern day consumer wishes to have his or her problem addressed in an immediate fashion, so it\u2019s hard not to understand why a\u00a0contact center service\u00a0would want to be as quick as possible in getting back to the patron. Yet, it\u2019s important that reps evaluate the situation from a macro level. An effective troubleshooting process starts\nwith the identification of all the concerns at hand and then logically working through them all. It can be a longer process, but it will teach reps to double-check, cross reference and test things before the problem is addressed.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

They discuss the feedback economy and how to leverage customer feedback to improve the\ncustomer experience\nLISTEN TO PODCAST\nTop Takeaways:\nCompanies spend billions of dollars building their brands, retail stores, and products. But, when it comes down to the moment that\u2019s most impactful for a customer, it usually comes down to their interaction with a customer service agent.\nThe feedback economy shifts the service model on its head. There is less focus on broadcasting why your company is great. The focus is on listening to the customer, understanding their pain points, and creating more systemic changes to address them.\nThere are thousands of avenues for empowered consumers to make their voices heard. You need the right tools to harness all this feedback and take action.\nSocial channels don\u2019t discriminate. Companies have to learn to change their processes, technologies, and products to be responsive. The customers need to be the center of a company\u2019s strategy.\nTechnology is only a piece of what it takes to get the customer service equation right. You need the right judgment and empathy to take action and help your customers.\nCustomer service happens throughout the entire customer journey. The overall user experience is a function of an ecosystem of partners for delivery. Employees, and in some instances, companies need to collaborate to create a great customer experience.\nPolicies should be rules or guidelines that empower employees to help the customer instead of hindering service.\nQuotes:\n\u201cThe customer is the center of everything that you do.\u201d\n\u201cAlways put the customer and their voice as your north star in how you think about providing service.\u201d\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it comes down to listening. Leverage your socials and content reviews as business assets.\u201d\n\u201cCustomer\nfeedback is your biggest resource.

It\u2019s been shown that:\nA 5% increase in customer retention can boost profits by 25%\nBrand promoters are worth 3x more than passive customers, and 7x more than detractors\nCompanies with greater retention rates account for 75% of that additional value, and encouraging a passive customer to become a promoter is roughly 3x more valuable than convincing a detractor to become passive\nThe truth is, many companies have difficulty acquiring and retaining customers. So what\u2019s the solution? How can you keep your business in motion and on an upward trend by not only bringing on new customers, but maintaining the customer relationships\nyou already possess?\nSimple. Analytics.\nIt\u2019s Good to Get Analytical.\nAnalytics are critical for maintaining and growing your customer base because they play a large role in making those customers feel cared for. Analytics allow you to reach the right customers at\nthe right time, increase your propensity to connect, convert and ensure customers are more likely to stay in contact with your brand. In addition, analytics let companies personalize the customer experience, reducing the need for mass sales pitches or\nblanket selling.\nOur extensive analytical capabilities track (among other metrics) time of day, lead demographics and scoring, bucket reports (funneling customers to help drive conversion) and number of call attempts. And yet, analytics are practically\nuseless unless you can truly put them to work.\nActionable Analytics: Why Analysis Matters\nThe sad truth is that analytics are often only reported, and not analyzed. This leads to lowered effectiveness for the company as well as decreased revenue opportunities,\nas potential sales are lost by continuing to mass-sell (versus targeting preferred demographics).\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Data enables companies to build warm lead lists, predict propensity to connect and increase first-attempt\nconnects, all of which can help increase your sales results as much as 20-25%.\nThe Bottom Line\nAccess to analytics is important, but analyzing the analytics \u2013 putting the data to work for you \u2013 that\u2019s where the difference is made. It\u2019s all about predictive models that leverage\ndiverse sources of data such as text, survey responses, and customer profiles. Our Center of Analytical Excellence has access to data from over 300 million households, which, when coupled with Alorica\u2019s 30 years of experience, allows us to fully\nanalyze and interpret information \u2013 and not just merely spit out numbers.\nThat\u2019s how you gain customers. That\u2019s how you keep customers. Simply put, that\u2019s what grows your company.

{"_id": "doc_515", "title": "Want to Recruit Millennials? Ignite Your Employer Brand.", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/want-to-recruit-millennials-ignite-your-employer-brand\nWant to Recruit Millennials? Ignite Your Employer Brand.\nShare this\nAre Millennials from Mars? There has been so much discussion about how to hire and retain this group\u2013which is almost 80 million strong now in the U.S. alone\u2013that one begins to wonder if they\u2019re from another planet. While understanding and decoding this group is paramount, there are ways to create a talent attraction strategy that appeals to them.1 The most important weapon is your employer brand.What is an employer brand\u2026and why should you care?As a textbook definition, your employer brand is your reputation as an employer. It reflects what your employees and the community think about\nyou. At its core, though, your employer brand is the story of your people behind the scenes.2It sheds light on the real reasons why they choose to work for you. Why do they get out of bed in the morning and go to work? What do they get out of it? And, when all of those people get together, what is the working environment and culture\nlike? The employer brand and employee value proposition\u00a0have become increasingly important as unemployment decreases and job seekers have more\nchoices than ever before.3 So they research. And they ask questions. And they talk to their friends and neighbors. And they\u2019ve decided that they won\u2019t work for a company with a bad reputation. In fact, in one study, almost\n70% of candidates\u00a0said they wouldn\u2019t take a job with a company that had a bad reputation, even if they were unemployed.4 \u00a0So how do you create a great employer brand? \u00a0 Building a truly compelling employer brand takes time. It\u2019s not a one-time project that can be completed in two weeks. However, there are four keys to building a strong employer brand over time.\nKey component #1:\u00a0Take time for self-reflectionEvery company has an identity. \u00a0It will typically include elements of your brand\u2019s purpose, your mission and overall core values. As you consider your employer brand, reflect upon those elements and really get to know yourself. What\u2019s\nimportant to your company, your CEO, your shareholders? What type of culture do you have (and do you want to have)? Is yours a company where people actually want to work? Why or why not? \u00a0 This is not a time for rose-colored glasses. Look in the mirror and examine the core elements of your company, warts and all. Consider point #2 as you do this.\nKey component #2:\u00a0Authenticity above all elseCandidates\u2013particularly millennials\u2013hate liars. Don\u2019t try to be something you\u2019re not. The whole point of this exercise is to match who you are as a company to what your target candidates are seeking and to make a quality match\nthere. As you develop your employer brand, stay true to who you are and wrap your branding around that.\nKey component #3:\u00a0Develop a purpose-driven EVPYour Employee Value Proposition (EVP) consolidates your employer brand into easy-to-understand bites. Millennials in particular are looking for trust and collaboration; strong relationships from their co-workers and their supervisors; engagement;\nauthentic feedback about their performance; and opportunities for growth. Does your EVP align to that?\nKey component #4:\u00a0Become a great storytellerYou have a great employer brand and compelling EVP, but don\u2019t believe the hype. Kevin Costner was wrong. In the real world, \u201cif you build it\u201d people will not come. You need to become a great storyteller to capture the attention of millennials\nand bring them to you. \u00a0 There\u2019s a \u201csecret sauce\u201d for how do this, and of course, it helps if your employer brand\u2019s voice and creative designs appeal to\nyour target candidates.5 But, make sure your designs reflect your company, too (see point #2). Once your EVP and stories are ready, include them in all components of your talent acquisition strategies and engage millennials where they congregate\n(e.g., social media). \u00a0 \u00a0 As companies fish in the same millennial talent pool, it will be crucial for you to differentiate yourself. By leveraging a compelling employer brand, you can do just that. \u00a0 SOURCES\n1.\u00a0Decoding Millennials, Alorica, 2017. https://alorica.com/insights/resource/decoding-millennials/.2.

We are a company of people, a company of ethics and a company that believes our first responsibility\nis to ensure that every Alorican is engaged, inspired and nurtured to succeed.\nAs Alorica\u2019s Chief Culture Officer, I don\u2019t take this responsibility lightly. And I know everything we do starts with our Core Values: Be Connected. Be Bold. Be Relentless. Be True. With COVID-19 forcing many of us to work\nfull-time from our homes, these values have taken on an even greater significance. They\u2019ve kept us united even as we physically work apart, and we\u2019ve taken them to heart as we continue to deliver insanely great customer service for many\nessential businesses\u2014including contact tracing, food delivery and content moderation.\nAs a minority-owned business, Alorica understands and can relate to the challenges faced by underserved populations and communities. It\u2019s why we stand up for those less fortunate, and it\u2019s what led us to launch TIDE: Together for Inclusion, Diversity & Equity.\nWe\u2019ve created regional TIDE Teams that lead local sites in conversations about the causes and issues that matter most to them. We\u2019ve facilitated respectful, fair and open dialogues about tough issues like racism, bias, sexual and gender\nidentity, mental health and more. And through them all, we\u2019ve learned about our people. We\u2019ve listened to their stories. And we\u2019ve grown\u2014together.\nWe take great pride in empowering our people to care for one another. Our non-profit partner, Making Lives Better with Alorica (MLBA), has supported team members around the world in times\nof crisis. Instead of corporate headquarters dictating where to give charitable contributions, each of our chapters has the autonomy to support their local communities\u2014and to-date, we\u2019ve given out almost $5M in grants\nin six different countries! Over the course of the pandemic, it has been our duty and privilege to donate time and resources to our local communities\u2014supporting causes and individuals in need.\nAll of these programs are certainly good for the soul\u2014but are they good for the business? In one emphatic word, YES! Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives have had a tremendous effect on Alorica\u2019s ability to hire and retain top talent. We\u2019re committed to Impact Sourcing\u2014through which we support economically-disadvantaged communities by offering local residents career opportunities.\nGiving people the chance to earn a living, support their families and make a difference in their neighborhoods is what it\u2019s all about; people naturally want to work for companies that do the right thing\u2014and so what\u2019s good for the\ncommunity is also good for the bottom line.\nAnd it\u2019s not just our people that care about our efforts\u2014our partners do too! Many of our clients also make strong commitments to CSR, and they want to team up with like-minded corporations. When culture and views on social responsibility\nalign, great partnerships are forged\u2014and we have been extremely fortunate to foster incredible relationships based on shared values.\nBeing insanely great starts with being exceptionally responsible, and it\u2019s an honor to lead Alorica\u2019s efforts in serving the common good. I\u2019m incredibly proud of what we\u2019ve achieved in a short amount of time, but we\u2019ve only\njust begun\u2014and there are awesome things to come!\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

Within only days, we\u2019ve successfully transitioned thousands of agents to an at-home environment\u2014and more\nare coming online each day! We\u2019re thrilled to take this opportunity to share new stories filled with passion, performance and very long hours\u2014and acknowledge accomplishments that truly shatter the status quo!\nOur entire Austin site has converted to a work-at-home environment! And it wasn\u2019t easy. Starting last Sunday, Sr. Site Director Tony Pi\u00f1on, his management team and the client were on-site\ngetting systems ready. The team then spent all of Monday and Tuesday deploying hundreds of production, ABAY and support staff into the at-home environment. Tony shared that the tremendous achievement wouldn\u2019t have been possible without everyone\nbanding together\u2014including the entire Austin management team, all the incredible agents, corporate partners and executive leadership.\nNext up, our Honduras site was just beginning to celebrate a partnership with a brand-new client, when the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 threatened to bring business to a halt. But\u2014our team snapped\ninto action and immediately started testing remote access by sending one agent home to log-in. When that worked, they mobilized a few more agents, and once they were confident in the solution, they contacted the client to share the good news. The\nclient was incredibly impressed with their proactive resolution, and soon the rest of the pieces fell into place. Site leadership determined which agents in the site met the requirements to work from home, launched training for the eligible employees\n(two weeks early, in fact!), and transitioned a great number of employees to Work-from-Home. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, we have an incredible story to share from our Newport News site! After quickly surveying their entire team to confirm who met the technology requirements to work remotely, site leaders made\nit happen in record time\u2014and transitioned more than a hundred employees in just a couple days! And they\u2019re not stopping there\u2014hundreds more employees are expecting to start working at home by the end of week. \u00a0 We\u2019d like to take this opportunity to say congratulations to all our teams who have risen to the occasion\u2014and to say thank you for your continued dedication to our clients and their customers.

Given the proliferation of mobile phones\u2014in the United States alone, there are 106 mobile phones per 100 people\u2014and the sustained popularity of social media websites like Facebook and Instagram, getting online has never been easier.And that\u2019s good news and bad news for customers and corporations.\u00a0 More People, More ProblemsWith so many people online, with multiplatform access 24/7/365, the potential for serious risk has increased exponentially. Online attacks take place every 39 seconds; and a staggering 59% of U.S. teens have been cyberbullied or threatened online2.\nIn just the past year alone, 69% of people have experienced online risks, including cyberbullying, hate speech, and threats of violence3.But it\u2019s not just people who are at risk\u2014over 55% of companies reported an increase in fraud-related losses4.\u00a0Companies also suffer regulatory and financial\npenalties from data breaches, from the 2014 data breach that cost Home Depot $179 million to Target\u2019s more recent $18.5M payout in 20175.Social media companies have found themselves particularly liable in recent years. The FTC regularly imposes multi-million dollar fines against them\u2026and contrary to common assumptions, Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency\nAct does not provide protection from being held liable for bad behaviors on their platforms6.And it\u2019s not just steep fines (and the bad publicity that comes with them) that companies have to worry about\u2014because with each incident, reputations suffer. Bearing in mind that approximately one in five customers would stop shopping with\nretailers whose data was hacked and stolen, online risks can have devastating consequences to a company\u2019s bottom line, from the largest big-box retailer to the local boutique.Trust & Safety strategies\u2014of which content moderation is an essential tool\u2014can help keep company information accurate and customers safe, even in an ever-changing, crowded online landscape.Understanding Legal and Reputational Risks (and How to Prevent Them)With so much at stake, companies need to prioritize risk mitigation. And to effectively meet the expectations of consumers, employees, and investors, that means adopting effective risk management programs based on actionable insights.But how can companies determine what their risks are, let alone know how to adopt formal programs that touch every aspect of their organizations?To help guide companies towards successful risk management efforts, we hosted a webinar dedicated to assessing organizational legal and reputational risks for actionable insights, featuring Adam Dorfman, VP of Product at Reputation.com, Joe Buggy, Alorica\u2019s\nHead of Trust & Safety, and Harry Folloder, SVP Chief Digital Officer at Alorica.The spirited, roundtable discussion covered a wealth of information, from explaining the nuances of assessing risk and best practices to AI\u2019s role in reputation management. Key takeaways included:\nLegal vs. reputational:\nAs exemplified by Home Depot and Target, legal risks can include lawsuits, judgements, and financial harm; reputational risks include the erosion of trust and customer losses.\nProactive risk assessment: Companies that regularly conduct risk assessments can stay one step ahead; this means seeking out customer feedback versus waiting for negative content to flourish online. Active monitoring and listening to customers\nin real time builds trust and helps ensure that negative, reputation-damaging online feedback is addressed quickly and effectively. Risk management adoption: Using frameworks helps companies decide how to approach risk management, including the total number of risks, percentage of organization affected, how have risks been mitigated historically, how many risks are monitored,\nand how many are mitigated. And once risks are assessed, have a process in place to help you plot and understand the scope each presents to the organization as a whole. Best Practices: By responding quickly to customer feedback online\u2014within 24 hours for negative feedback, and two days for positive feedback\u2014companies show customers that they\u2019re listening to them, which positively impacts\nboth sentiment and retention. The role of AI: While AI can be a great tool for businesses, it also allows spam to proliferate; companies can circumvent potential risks by shifting to video testimonials, confirmed customer prioritization, or just by adding check marks to\ncustomers or purchases to add validation. \u00a0Just Do SomethingPerhaps the biggest takeaway from our panel discussion was that when it comes to mitigating risks, companies can\u2019t sit on the sidelines. They must act\u2014and act fast\u2014or they\u2019ll face serious consequences.Acting starts with companies understanding that there are external forces out there that can do serious harm to their bottom lines, and tracking risks accordingly. That doesn\u2019t have to mean creating Risk Mitigation departments\u2014simply asking\nexploratory questions to identify risks and creating a spreadsheet to track them can put companies on the path to less risks and happier customers.

I\u2019m so grateful to work at a company like Alorica where I\u2019m personally encouraged to be bold, and my\nteams run with it when I challenge them to do the same. Because after 30 years in the biz, I can say with certainty that YOU are your best advocate, and you have the power to make things happen for yourself.\nWhen I first started out as a call center agent in my 20\u2019s, I didn\u2019t know it would take me to where I am today\u2014the President of North America and Europe Operations for one of the largest digital CX providers in the world.\nBut I saw others shatter the status quo before me (and certainly after me!) by first delivering on their promise and then going for those new, kinda scary and bigger opportunities. I decided to follow that example and lead in the same way. So, don\u2019t\nwait for someone to come tap you. Never say \u201cno\u201d to a chance to learn more skills. Make mistakes, learn from them, and move on. As I often say, \u201cget over it.\u201d You never know where the next opportunity lies when you do these\nthings. Most importantly, don\u2019t follow a career path; build the one that\u2019s meant for you.\nThis month is about honoring the women in our lives and committing to #BreakTheBias\u2014the theme celebrated around the world for International Women\u2019s Day. Furthering diversity and inclusion\u00a0is,\nand should be, a top priority for us all. Besides being the right thing to do, it enhances our business, company culture, and especially our people. At Alorica, we even have the numbers to prove it\u2014our female population has grown since last\nyear with now 62% of our global workforce made up of women. Not only that, but as the largest certified and award-winning minority-owned BPO, we have also increased the number of minorities within our U.S. workforce to 71%. Why are these facts important?\nBecause strong representation of groups, such as women and minorities, matter to our employees, our clients and our customers\u2014even more so now as we look toward the future of work. And it matters to me that as a company, we are making progress.\nThere\u2019s much work to be done, but we are taking meaningful steps in the right direction.\nAs we continue Women\u2019s History Month, I\u2019d like to take a moment to celebrate some qualities that make women special: how much we care as well as our passion, sensitivity and resilience when dealing with change. These qualities, which have\nsometimes been misconstrued in the workplace as weakness, actually demonstrate our strength. We aren\u2019t afraid to show these skills with conviction, strong execution and thoughtful leadership, and sometimes wearing bright-red heels.

But to attract and retain this diverse talent, we need to\nfocus on creating a culture of inclusivity that encourages individuality. Here are some of the benefits of being part of a global company with an inclusive mindset.\u00a01. Exploring new markets with confidence\u00a0We are in the era where global presence has become a defining element of success. A diverse talent pool enables companies to harness the cultural knowledge of their employees, thereby understanding the local nuances that\nare an integral part of consumer behaviors and preferences. This helps brands penetrate new markets effectively and stay ahead of anticipated risks while exploring new opportunities. Our operational footprint across NA, APAC, LATAM and EMEA enable\nus to best support our customers worldwide with\u00a0#LimitlessPossibilities\u00a02.\nEmpowering growth\nEmployees want to do their best work for leaders they trust and respect. An inclusive leadership team is a key selling point for recruiting best-in-class talent and boosting a company\u2019s reputation as an employer of choice. Employees excel\nin their performance when they feel encouraged to be their true selves in their workplace, and when they see diversity within their leadership team. Alorica is proud to be a certified diverse supplier with strong minority and female representation\naround the world. Last year, we promoted 5,000 employees globally and more than half were women. We were also specifically recognized earlier this year for our Achievement in Promoting & Developing Women. #EnhancedPerformance3. Supporting communitiesMaking lives better starts with individuals but extends much farther than that. Inclusivity goes beyond workplace dynamics. By providing opportunities to local employees from all walks of life\u2014different ages, ethnicities, genders, interests,\nskills, education\u2014to interact with, solve problems for customers, and grow professionally, companies have a positive ripple effect that impacts communities. This is seen through job creation, economic development, corporate social responsibility\ncontributions and more. As an example,\u00a0 as part of our skilling program in India, we also hire undergraduates and offer extended skills training for career advancement. #PassionatePeopleI can confidently say that one of Alorica\u2019s top differentiators is our people and the corporate culture we\u2019re building together.

{"_id": "doc_538", "title": "Chat with our Chatbot: The Future of Recruitment", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/chat-with-our-chatbot-the-future-of-recruitment\nChat with our Chatbot: The Future of Recruitment\nShare this\nThe Oxford dictionary defines a chatbot as 'a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the internet.' As is often the case with new technology, many initial chatbots were created for fun, but they\u2019re now being\nused to enhance the workplace, particularly in HR departments. How you ask? Job interviews can be incredibly stressful for applicants. Chatbots provide a level of comfort and, ironically, emotional distance that can promote efficient and relaxed conversations.\nRecruitment chatbots can stage initial interviews that are direct, friendly, and minimally intimidating. It\u2019s also simply a better, faster and easier way to connect with qualified candidates. This is a win-win for both applicants and HR teams.\nAt Alorica, we have been testing this method of recruitment in the Philippines by embedding the technology onto the Alorica Philippines Facebook page, conducting screenings via Facebook Messenger. To measure the effectiveness of this method, the technology\nhad to solve the following challenges: maximize online recruiting channels; generate inactive leads; and reduce manual phone call outreach to candidate leads. In the span of just three months, the results have already been overwhelmingly positive! During\nthe testing period, 3,088 candidates were interviewed, compared to 966 during the same period a year prior. There was a savings of more than 1,200 recruiting man hours and the cost per hire reduced by 84 percent. Additionally, online channel conversion\nrate was up to 14-16 percent compared to traditional channels at 4-6 percent. \u00a0 To sum it up, chatbots have completely changed the way Alorica thinks about recruiting. By implementing the technology, we have not only saved money and man hours, but\nallowed us to connect with qualified candidates who resonated with this recruitment strategy. It just goes to show, the trick to getting face time is a little screen time. \u00a0 Alorica is one of the biggest outsourcing employers in the region with 17\nsites strategically located across metro Manila and provincial regions.

As physicians - and fluid regulations - continue to restrict access to outside reps, the industry has had to shift to accommodate doctors who are spending more time with patients and less time being solicited.\nAccording to a study by Doctors.net.uk,\u00a052 percent of the more than 1,0001\u00a0general\npractitioners surveyed did not see any pharmaceutical sales representatives in a typical week, while just 26 percent only saw one rep in the same time period. No-see doctors are impacting the medical field in a way that is negative for big pharmaceutical\ncompanies, but as physicians spend less time in front of sales reps, they can focus more on patient health. A general lack of time was cited as the No. 1 reason why doctors don't see sales reps anymore, with 38 percent of respondents saying they were\ntoo busy to meet with sales executives. Another 15 percent said that seeing reps was against practice policy.\nNo-see doctors mean industry wide changes This shift is affecting all aspects of the health care industry, not just sales and marketing reps. Patients are beneficiaries of no-see doctors because they see more individual attention, but on the other\nhand, practices aren't able to take in as many patients as they used to, hence limiting business to a certain extent. On the back end of operations, doctors now have to manually enter patient information into electronic health record databases and\nsubmit prescriptions themselves, so a higher level of accountability has been placed on physicians as a result, according to Clark Ridge, vice president of client health care services at Alorica.\n\"The level of accuracy, receiving greater scrutiny, I think you're just saying spend a little more time with each patient asking questions and getting information right,\" Ridge said. \"To a doctor, though, it's had a negative impact on their ability to\ngenerate revenue because it's reduced the number of people they're able to see.\"\nRidge added that as insurance companies adopt new policies, such as reimbursement rates determined by patient satisfaction scoring, the trickle-down effect of no-see and hard-to-see doctors may be more wide-sweeping than first thought. No longer are general\nphysician practices overstaffing themselves to the point where people are in the waiting room for long periods of time before they see a doctor.\nOutsourced assistance could prove useful Now that doctors are spending more time with each patient, chances of retention are higher due to a more personalized experience. On the front end of doctor's office visits, practices have been implementing\nstreamlined services for patients to check in and schedule appointments. For example, individuals can now go online and book a time to visit their physician, and when they show up for their consultations, they can check-in using an automated kiosk.\nAlthough the adoption of the electronic sign-in has been slow, Ridge said it could greatly benefit the practices that implement such systems.\n\"To really take advantage of efficiency, outsourcing some of that interaction to a group of individuals that don't have to be on-site and can capture the information is a much less costly alternative,\" he said. \"Where completeness and accuracy are key,\noutsourcing is a great option.\"\nSOURCES1http://www.pmlive.com/blogs/digital_intelligence/archive/2012/aug_2012/uk_doctors_pharma_sales_reps_digital_418566\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc_543", "title": "Outsourcing: The Cure for What Ails Your Company", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/outsourcing-the-cure-for-what-ails-your-company\nOutsourcing: The Cure for What Ails Your Company\nShare this\nIn 2015, over 2.3 million jobs were outsourced1. It\u2019s an increasingly popular way to do business; by freeing up internal resources,\ncosts are reduced and customers are afforded access to technology, tools and best practices that aren\u2019t generally available internally.\nTop providers in our industry have years of experience and are fast, agile and adaptable. But how do you know if outsourcing is the right solution for you? Or when it is the right solution?\nRead on, dear friends. Read on.\nSix Scenarios When Outsourcing Makes Sense\n1. You want to retain customers.\nTHE SITUATION\nYour current customers are happy, but your business is struggling to maintain \u2013 and improve \u2013 an already exceptional level of service.\nTHE SOLUTION\nBusiness Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies build and develop multi-skilled agent profiles that allow you to continue offering superior customer care while exploring all-new service solutions \u2013 chat, video, etc. (often, platforms that have not\nyet been considered).\n2. You want to acquire new customers.\nTHE SITUATION\nBringing in new business generates revenue, but you may need additional guidance in recruiting and retaining top sales agents who can bolster your bottom line.\nTHE SOLUTION\nWhile focusing on creating the best experiences for your end customer, BPO companies can provide resources that get the job done and drive exceptional business outcomes \u2013 as it turns out, we are experts at recruiting and retaining the right agent\nprofile to meet your business needs. Keep in mind \u2013 companies that utilize strong omnichannel customer engagement strategies see, on average, a 9.5% increase in annual revenue2.\n3. Specialized training requires detailed education.\nTHE SITUATION\nCertain products and services simply take more time to fully grasp. Training classes can be time-consuming and resource-draining, and often there\u2019s just too much for one trainer to know \u2013 but additional coaching can\u2019t be supported by\nyour in-house team.\nTHE SOLUTION\nWith a BPO company, you can employ a wide range of skills and services. We partner with our clients to fully develop training curriculums with a wide variety of courses, and hire dedicated recruiters and QA analysts to ensure goals are met.\n4. Seasonal ramps are just that. Seasonal.\nTHE SITUATION\nHigh-peak seasons mean all hands on deck. But you most likely don\u2019t have hundreds of extra seats in your internal centers to handle the additional, often unpredictable, push.\nTHE SOLUTION\nBPO companies are there precisely when you need them. They can handle the size of the ramp effectively, providing you with options in multiple time zones, and facilitating brick-and-mortar, work-at-home and blended agent models to build tailored solutions.\nWe excel at finding you tenured resources and complementary seasonal programs, so that you\u2019re always staffed with the most qualified talent.\n5. Rapid growth is not without its pitfalls.\nTHE SITUATION\nAs your company expands, you may find yourself needing fast \u2013 and thoughtful \u2013 solutions to fill resources and maintain customer service expectations. But when service is being backfilled by 6. internal workers, your business simply loses\nthe ability to train new people to plug the gaps and keep up with demand.\nTHE SOLUTION\nA BPO provider takes away the pressures of you having to supply all the answers, because of the flexibility built into the outsourcing model. BPOs give you instant access to scalability, letting you ramp up and down quickly and allowing you to return\nto focusing solely on the business, in-house processes or other ventures.\nYou don\u2019t have all the tech you need.\nTHE SITUATION\nIt\u2019s all about analytics and omnichannel solutions; if your in-house analytics are not customer-focused, you could receive unreliable data and metrics. And if your customer service is restricted to a single channel, you\u2019re missing out on opportunities\nto enhance customer experience and loyalty.\nTHE SOLUTION\nBPOs have deep experience with analytics \u2013 going beyond the raw data and providing useful analysis that yields deeper partnerships and stronger metrics. And by being able to blend agents on multiple customer service channels \u2013 voice, email,\nchat, text, video and social media \u2013 customer loyalty to your brand can be enhanced for the long-term.\n***\nYour company is constantly trying to meld customer needs with your unique business culture and values.

This is where microlearning comes in \u2013 it meets this expectation of consuming information, while increasing learner satisfaction. Defined as a way of teaching and delivering content in small bursts, microlearning has been a key success factor for our agents and clients including a major retail pharmacy provider.\nManaging millions of customer prescriptions daily, this pharmacy provider began to experience some challenges with prescription fulfillment compliance. The impacts were significant, ranging from financial loss to medication abuse, and in this highly-regulated industry, it was simply unacceptable. To fix the problem, Alorica was tasked with delivering an interventional learning approach that not only improved process compliance, but would also increase employee interest and attention. The solution? You guessed it, microlearning.\nInstead of a traditional four-hour re-training intervention using a PowerPoint presentation, we implemented microlearning \u2014 where we created a customized, brief, 10-minute video allowing agents to understand the importance of customer verification. In doing so, this helped close the culture gap to better align with client expectations. A little over a month into the program, we began collecting data on the effectiveness of the program and the results spoke for themselves \u2013 the compliance rating improved to as high as 96%. There was also a cost saving \u2014 with an average of four training hours per full-time employee.\nThanks to this new training method, the team that underwent this pilot program greatly outperformed other internal sites using traditional re-training tools. Playing a major role in its success is microlearning\u2019s digestible nature; these short videos help agents retain 20% more information, while encouraging participation and conversation during the sessions. Furthermore, these microlearnings were cost-effective, resulting in cutting development costs (i.e. creating training collateral, salary for trainers, etc.).\nWe know your business has unique customer needs and we\u2019re here to make sure our agents who provide customer service on your behalf are fully informed and engaged to make lives better, one interaction at a time.

As Everest Group\u2019s analysts observed, outsourcing is more cost-effective for companies no matter the economic climate. Outsourcing Trust & Safety initiatives, including content moderation\nand content management, empowers multi-dimensional, multilingual content moderation at scale\u2014something we, as a veteran BPO industry leader, can easily attest to. As we\u2019ve found, by acting as an extension of a client\u2019s\nbusiness, we\u2019ve been able to provide seamless support while improving the customer experience without incurring risks for our clients.\nIdentify the most viable shoring mix. Going offshore (and nearshore) for Trust & Safety efforts makes dollars and sense per Everest Group\u2019s analysis. As they note, even large tech firms have been shifting their content\nmanagement and related needs to cost-effective locations in APAC and LATAM. In our experience, by leveraging our global workforce and delivery models, including work-at-home, hybrid, and gig workforce solutions, clients can empower safe\nspaces online, as well as maximize ROI in any economic climate.\nLeverage alternative talent models for non-sensitive work types within Trust & Safety. Having a diverse workforce mix makes content moderation and other Trust & Safety initiatives manageable; and, as Everest Group rightly notes,\nhybrid workforces featuring full-time and gig workers have become increasingly common in the post-Covid-19 landscape. Outsourcing optimized, global workforces like Alorica\u2019s empowers companies to safeguard online communities with\nease; we also invest heavily in our employee wellbeing to ensure that our talent is always up to the task.\nAdopt a pragmatic approach to digital investments. Large technology firms often partner with third-party service providers to leverage their talent pools and harness new technologies. Outsourcing, as Everest Group illustrates, makes\nit possible for companies of all sizes to harness cutting-edge technologies to improve content moderation and customer support simultaneously. Alorica\u2019s clients and their customers enjoy the latest technology and optimal support\nwithout impacting their bottom lines.\nBut this is just the beginning, per Everest Group, because outsourcing Trust & Safety also helps reduce attrition, creates more resilient workforces, and reduces portfolio risks\u2014all things we couldn\u2019t agree with more.\u00a0\u00a0Want to Learn More?\u00a0If you\u2019ve got questions about offshoring, workforce optimization, Trust & Safety, or just need great support yesterday, we\u2019ve got answers.Get in touch\nto find your perfect solution!\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

Challenge accepted.\nTHE CHALLENGE\nIntroduce \u2018microlearning\u2019 to revolutionize training protocols\nBoost KPI scores\nWin over a skeptical client\nTHE OUTCOME\nPilot-site process compliance hit 96% to goal 60 days after training, besting non-pilot sites by as much as 62%\nCost savings: on average, we reduced retraining time by as much as 80% per full-time employee\nMicrolearning content was integrated right from the start in the new-hire training program\nTHE CHALLENGE\nConvince the Client. Boost the Scores. Win the Day.\nThis one was a bit tricky. We were tasked with delivering an interventional learning approach that needed to improve process compliance as well as keep employee interest and attention. More than 95% of the pilot site\u2019s team was made up\nof Millennials, and so applying a teaching method that would resonate was of supreme importance.\nFurthermore, our mission also entailed boosting KPI scores. Toss in a client that was skeptical of new approaches to training, and you could say we had a lot to prove using microlearning.\nChallenge accepted.\nTHE SOLUTION\nBetter Technology. Better Retention. Better Scores.\nInstead of traditional classroom retraining intervention marathons, we championed microlearning: a short, animated video that focused\non client-specific goals (in this case, the importance of improving compliance). Brief, animated stories assisted agents with understanding the importance of customer verification, and in doing so helped close a culture gap to better align with client\nexpectations.\nTHE OUTCOME\nMicrolearning Makes Its Mark.\nThanks to the new training method, the pilot site greatly outperformed other internal sites using traditional retraining methods. Playing a major role in its success is microlearning\u2019s\ndigestible nature; these short videos help agents retain 20% more information while encouraging participation and conversation during training sessions. Furthermore, microlearning is cost-effective, minimizing the need for traditional classroom training\nand ultimately cutting development costs by 50%.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

Not only is she Alorica's Asia-Pacific Chief of Staff, she is the MLBA Philippines\u2019 Program Administrator AND a member of the Board of Trustees for the Healthcare Information Management Association\nof the Philippines! We know you\u2019re all wondering\u2014how does Sarah do it?! What's her secret?\u00a0Sarah credits the following:\u00a0Take risks, change your attitude to gratitude and build a family-like culture. \u00a0 Read about Sarah's insanely great professional journey below, and learn how you too can change the game!\nDescribe your background and career path I started on the phones as an agent in 2003, but knew that I really wanted to be a trainer. I applied a few times, and when I finally got the opportunity, it was awesome! Then\nwith some encouragement, I transitioned into operations\u2014first as an Operations Manager\u2014and have since been growing within the organization.\nWhat\u2019s an example of a choice you made that you are proud of or that served as a turning point in your career? Taking risks. Too often, we make \u2018safe\u2019 decisions\u2014but the times that I have taken\nrisks and embraced opportunities outside of my comfort zone have turned out to be game changers!\nCould you offer any professional advice to employees who are just starting out?Just be you.\u00a0You are where you are for a reason, so step up and show up! Work hard and be a good example to others. Don\u2019t hurt\nothers along the way, be grateful and learn from the rough roads. And finally, change your attitude to gratitude.What\u2019s an example of a challenge you experienced at work? (Any due to being female?) How did you approach the problem and what were the results? Back in the day, the biggest challenge I faced was not\nhaving the appropriate tools and training for the job I wanted. My transition into a leadership role was tough. So, I went ahead and learned how I thought best. I made sure to sit next to a genius workforce person, so I could learn terminology, computations\nand how to optimize tools. I learned from leaders and my peers around me, and never stopped inquiring. I watched and I asked\u2014and I still do that to this day. \u00a0 I always look at everyone as my equal, no matter the title or experience. Today,\nwhen I present to organizations, I find very few women at the table\u2014but I tell myself that my voice will stand out and be heard no matter what.\nWhat is your advice on how to make meaningful connections? Listen and share. The more we listen to one another, the more we learn\u2014and vice versa. And Share what you know, because it makes your environment and\nsupport system stronger.\nWhat is your favorite thing about working at Alorica, and what do you find most rewarding in your role? My favorite has got to be everyone I interact with\u2014it\u2019s such a family atmosphere! We\u2019ve got the\nbrightest, most creative and hardest-working people at Alorica\u2014and that makes me want to strive to be better every day. The most rewarding part for me is seeing so many coworkers grow within the organization; we\u2019ve all been a part of one\nanother\u2019s success in some shape or form, and we look out for each other.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc_566", "title": "3 Principles of Social Media Customer Service", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/3-principles-of-social-media-customer-service\n3 Principles of Social Media Customer Service\nShare this\nMultichannel customer service is no longer a luxury that progressive companies use, it's become an industry norm. A study conducted by social analytics company Simply Measured found that 99 percent of brands surveyed1 were on Twitter, while another 30 percent had a specifically dedicated customer service account, Social Media Examiner said, citing Simply Measured statistics. It's becoming increasingly evident that customer service and social media can go hand in hand.\nWith that in mind, here are three principles to consider about social media customer service:\n1. Different channel, same service: Just because there's a more relaxed aura surrounding online network users doesn't mean companies should sacrifice the service provided via social media. While the interaction can be more lighthearted, the end goal is to directly address any question, comment or concern that a consumer may have. Depending on the severity of the issue, a brand may want to just be straightforward and communicate in a professional manner. However, if a customer makes a lighthearted comment, then the company can reciprocate and show their personal side as well. The objective is to create strong relationships in a highly interactive\nchannel.\n2. The quicker the response, the better: The average response time for respondents in the Simply Measured study was five hours, with 10 percent of businesses responding within the hour. Although it's difficult to assemble a qualified team to patrol social media at all hours of the day, a timely response is best practice when it comes to real\u00adtime communication. A Lithium Technologies study found that 53 percent of consumers2 expect a company to respond to their tweet within an hour, and that figure jumps to 72 percent when they have a complaint. If brands neglect to respond, consumers take punishing actions. For example, 60 percent of respondents said they'd be more inclined to express their dissatisfaction publicly.\n3. A social persona should be passive: When it comes to customer response, companies need to be aggressive in finding a solution as quickly as possible. However, the overall personality of a business online should be informative and passive, if anything. There are going to be unpleasant patrons no matter which channel a company explores, but that doesn't give it a free pass to negatively react. An intimidating post or poor reaction often leads to the wrong kind of publicity. Engaging in an argument with a customer or another business online will always be a losing proposition.\nSOURCES\n1 \u00a0http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/exceptional-customer-service-on-twitter/\n2 \u00a0http://www.lithium.com/company/news-room/press-releases/2013/consumers-will-punish-brands-that-fail-to-respond-on-twitter-quickly\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

Utilities Need an Expert in PCI Compliance", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/do-you-know-where-your-customers-data-is-utilities-need-an-expert-in-pci-compliance\nDo You Know Where Your Customers' Data Is? Utilities Need an Expert in PCI Compliance\nShare this\nSecurity sure isn\u2019t what it used to be! If the recent data breaches of high profile and sophisticated companies in the healthcare, retail and finance industries have taught us anything, it\u2019s that businesses need to seriously assess their data\nsecurity. Now more than ever, utility companies are high profile targets of attempted data theft, with hackers taking advantage of lax security standards.\nPhysical and operational data security should be a top priority for your utility company, particularly when selecting an outsourcing partner. Developing strategies that protect your customers\u2019 data is an essential component of providing top-notch\ncustomer service. But to provide your customers with the highest levels of service and security, it\u2019s important that you look for a partner who can go beyond simply protecting credit card and payment data to also identifying systems that can\nbe used to breach multi-factor authentication techniques.\nWhen selecting an outsourcing partner, here are three considerations your utility company should keep in mind:\nIs your outsourcing partner certified Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant?Whether your utility company is PCI compliant (but prefers to outsource payment arrangements and processing for cost savings or to provide a better customer experience), or you are not PCI compliant in-house, it\u2019s critically important that\nyour outsourcing partner is certified PCI compliant.\nThere are, however, varying levels of PCI compliance. Many companies claiming to be PCI compliant have not achieved these higher levels of certification, but rather, tout \u201cself-assessment\u201d\u2014which essentially means that they may not have\nbeen independently assessed, nor approved, by leading credit card providers.\nBe sure to ask the following questions to understand the level of PCI compliance a potential outsourcing partner can offer:\nIs the outsourcing partner PCI compliant?If yes, has their compliance been certified by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA), or are they self-assessed?Is the Supplier listed on the VISA and MasterCard registered Supplier list?Being certified by a QSA shows an additional investment in the compliance process and likely investment in infrastructure to keep your data safe. To find outsourcing partners certified by a QSA, visit the\u00a0PCI Security Standard\u2019s website1\u00a0and view their list of certified companies.\nCan your outsourcing partner safeguard non-payment data?In 2013,\u00a045 percent of data thefts2\u00a0involved non-payment card\ndata. Protecting your customers\u2019 payment data is vitally important, but focusing only on securing the payment data can leave your customers\u2019 other personal data vulnerable.\nRemember\u2014it\u2019s not just payment data at risk, so it\u2019s important to ask your outsourcing partner whether they are safeguarding data throughout the customer journey or only during payment processes. Particularly in a regulated industry\nlike utilities, customers expect that their data is private and secure. They expect data like their account number, phone number, address and social security number to be as safe as their credit card number.\nIf non-payment data is breached, it could potentially harm your brand. In 2012, nearly 2 million customers of two\u00a0 New York-based utility companies3\u00a0had\npersonal data such as their social security numbers, birthdates and other account information exposed. Since then, the threat of a data breach has only grown. To ensure the security of all data\u2014payment and non-payment\u2014ask your outsourcing\npartner whether they meet security expectations in every interaction and for every type of data collected.\nDoes your outsourcing partner provide an exceptional experience throughout the customer journey?You may be selecting an outsourcing partner based on their ability to provide high levels of PCI compliance and security measures, but it\u2019s also important to consider how a third party company interacts with your customers. \u00a0 Consider questions\nlike these:\nDo your customers have the same experience with your payment processing partner as they do with your own representatives?How much control do you have over these interactions?Is your partner committed to providing an\u00a0exceptional customer experience4\u00a0every time?Is your partner actively working to build your brand and enhance NPS\u00ae and customer satisfaction outcomes?Now that customers can easily switch their utility providers, it\u2019s more important than ever to take into consideration the entire customer journey and their interactions with front line representatives. A study published in the\u00a0Harvard Business Review5\u00a0last year showed that less than half (43%) of utilities customers who have a negative experience are still members after a year, compared to 74% who have positive\nexperiences. You need to be certain you\u2019re not losing customers because of poor customer interactions with your outsourcing partner!\nSelecting the right outsourcing partner is about more than payment processing. It\u2019s about securing your customer\u2019s data\u2014all of it\u2014and ensuring that every interaction with your customers is exceptional. If you keep all this in mind\nwhen choosing your partner, you\u2019ll likely succeed at finding a partnership that\u2019s truly win-win.\nSOURCES\n1 \u00a0https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/qualified_security_assessors.php\n2 \u00a0http://www.forbes.com/sites/frontline/2014/07/07/payment-card-data-isnt-the-only-lucrative-loot-in-a-data-breach/\n3 \u00a0http://www3.dps.ny.gov/pscweb/WebFileRoom.nsf/Web/1986D5ECA1917A8A8525798E005F81DD/$File/pr12007.pdf?OpenElement\n4 \u00a0https://alorica.com/outcomes/actionable-insights/alorica-analytics/ 5 \u00a0https://hbr.org/2014/08/the-value-of-customer-experience-quantified/\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc_570", "title": "What Makes a Company a Great Place to Work?", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/what-makes-a-company-a-great-place-to-work\nWhat Makes a Company a Great Place to Work?\nAuthored By: Asma Sultana\nShare this\nThe company you work for matters; oftentimes we spend more time working with our colleagues than even seeing our friends and family. As I reflect on my last 20+ years working as a global Talent Acquisition leader, I've come to realize that the concept of an ideal workplace varies greatly from person to person. It hinges on factors like our personal goals, age, interests, location, financial situation and more. Job seekers\u2019 preferences can shift daily, but there's one constant thread that unites us. Regardless of our job title or experience level, we all seek out companies that foster a culture of support, growth and inclusion.While there's no one-size-fits-all way to tell if a company prioritizes its employees, there are a few qualities that all the best companies embody.A Diverse Workforce Any company can say DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) is important to them, but you want to look for employers that can give concrete examples of their commitment. Do they have diverse representation across their workforce? What about within their leadership team? There are many benefits to a strong DEI-focused culture; it allows employees to feel comfortable being themselves and confident to do their best work. According to the McKinsey report Delivering through Diversity, diverse companies attract top talent and have better financial performance. At Alorica, a global CX provider, diversity is in our roots. We are the largest certified minority-owned BPO and as an example, 60% of our workforce is made up of women. In fact, we won an award for our Achievement in Promoting and Developing Women.\u00a0 We are also proud to be awarded as a Top Place to Work by Ragan Awards for our DEI initiatives. Healthy Work-Life BalanceWhen you're considering potential employers, work-life balance should be non-negotiable. Achieving a healthy balance between your personal and professional life has a significant impact on your mental and physical well-being. Research from Frontiers Media has shown that when there's a conflict between work and life, it can lead to lower productivity and performance, potentially holding back your career. At Alorica, we offer a standard five-day work week and organize free health talk sessions as well as health checkup camps. Through our TIDE (Together for Inclusion Diversity and Equity) program, we create a safe and welcoming space for employees to openly and respectfully discuss social issues we face in our communities. Opportunities for Learning and Growth There is nothing quite like a workplace that values your growth and development. Whether it is through training programs, new projects or helping another team, finding a company that believes in your potential and is ready to invest in it is key. It opens limitless possibilities in your career, making you more adaptable and versatile. As leaders, we can kickstart this process for future leaders. I take pride in being part of a company that invests in its employees at all levels, whether they are just starting or seasoned leaders. We get the chance to learn new skills through training programs led by experts from around the globe, which makes us more capable of tackling fresh challenges. Over 80% of our management roles last year were filled from internal promotions. That is the result of working for a company that cares about its people and their career journey.So now you know what to look for, but how do you know what a company\u2019s work culture is really like? You can:Dive into their website to see if their values, mission and activities resonate with you. Ask yourself, \u2018is this a company (or leader) I\u2019d be proud to work for?Don\u2019t shy away from asking questions during the interview that help YOU decide if you want the job. We love candidates who are clear about their expectations and eager to learn more about our company.Go check out the work environment. Can you imagine working there? Alorica offers walk-in interviews at our sites so that we can make the hiring process very efficient. We get to know our candidates in person and they get a sense of who we are too!\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

Over 4.74B people use social media platforms\u2014including\nover 75% of the global population aged 13 and up\u2014resulting in a worldwide daily average use of nearly 2.5 hours1.\nAnd with so many people online, creating safe spaces to transact and interact is becoming more challenging than ever before.\u00a0\u00a0A Seismic Shift Meets a Clear and Present Danger\u00a0The world is online, using social media to share opinions and argue talking points in numbers never seen before; in the U.S. alone, a staggering 84% of 18-29 year olds are active social media users, with numbers only falling slightly to 81% for 30-49\nyear olds2.\u00a0Unfortunately, explicit content, misleading information, deepfake videos, and conspiracy theories are skyrocketing alongside an explosion in platform use. Such material erodes trust and confidence in our country\u2019s (and indeed the world\u2019s)\nmost critical institutions\u2014and puts individuals, brands and even established traditions at risk. \u202f\u00a0So, what do you do to counter a growing digital threat?\u00a0You deploy a combination of leading-edge technology and human oversight\u2014and you select a partner who understands how to get the job done.\u202f\u202f\u00a0Five Keys to Consider\u00a0Deploying successful content moderation is no small task\u2014and it\u2019s critical to get it right before bad actors can impact your brand reputation.\u00a0\u00a0Here are five factors to keep in mind when selecting a partner: \u202f\u00a0Speed to Scale: Find a partner who can easily support your needs\u2014especially when they\u2019re urgently needed. Your ideal partner should be able to support rapid ramps worldwide, handle high volumes of published content, and have\na legacy of ramping programs swiftly and successfully.\u00a0\u00a0Trust & Safety Expertise: Experience matters\u2014especially with content moderation. And that takes a combination of top-tier talent plus safety protocols and regulatory know-how to keep both clients and frontline moderators secure;\nthe best partners have both.\nPerformance: A great partner has a proven track record plus a platform that harnesses automation technology, AI, and deep analytics to make easy work of moderating multi-media content.\nTalent & Training: Top-tier talent doesn\u2019t just happen\u2026a trust-worthy partner hires, trains, coaches, and fortifies their frontline content moderators, ensuring consistency and scalability in any region. A solid partner\ncontinually optimizes the capabilities of its workforce to consistently deliver through ongoing training, from expanding existing skillsets to keeping up with policy changes.\nWellness: Best-practice based wellness policies are essential for content moderation success\u2014partners should care for their people by offering global wellness and resiliency programs led by licensed mental health practitioners. Daily\nmonitoring of employee wellness, mood, and satisfaction also helps ensure that your first line of defense is always up for the task.\u00a0We\u2019re In This Together\u00a0While the world is more connected than ever, our interlocked societies struggle with bad actors who sully digital platforms with vitriol, manipulation, and lies. Major platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok have recently stepped-up activities\nto curtail the spread of misleading information, but free-speech arguments are quick to emerge\u2014and the moderation landscape is evolving daily. \u202f\u00a0Like it or not,\u202fsocial media\u202fhas become\u202fthe media\u2014and though journalists possess credentials and routinely fact-check their work product, everyday citizens do not. So, it\u2019s imperative that we prioritize moderation efforts\nand empower our people to safeguard online interests. \u202f\u00a0At the end of the day, the content is here\u2014and moderation is there to meet it.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Are you ready?To learn more visit our  Content Moderation page to see how Alorica can help you create Trust & Safety centers of excellence within your business.\u00a01 Hootsuite. 2\u00a0Oberlo.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

You\u2019ll Need a Strategic Framework First", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/getting-into-contact-center-automation-youll-need-a-strategic-framework-first\nGetting Into Contact Center Automation? You\u2019ll Need a Strategic Framework First\nShare this\nDeciding to make the move to automation is one thing. Knowing where to start is another. No doubt you\u2019ve done your homework\u2014read the latest blogs and eBooks like\u00a05 Ways to Drive Calls Out of Your Call Center\u2014 yet you still can\u2019t quite figure out how to get started.\nThat\u2019s why you need to build a strategic framework for self-service.\u00a0 Remember, automation does not replace a human connection. It augments it. By following a guided approach for building a strategic framework, you\u2019ll be able to distinguish\nthe simple from complex and work out what exactly makes the most sense to automate. Creating your framework is as simple as two steps.\nStep 1: Dial in on DemographicsConsider the demographic of your caller\u2014and your industry. A West Interactive Services CX Marks the Spot study found that customers\u2019 likelihood to embrace a shift to self-service depends on the service provided.1\nTake the Government Services/Healthcare sector, for example. While there is a larger appetite for interactive channels including online chat, self-help, etc., fewer customers are open to a mobile platform or social media forum. By contrast, in the Automotive\nsector, the appetite for a mobile solution is much greater, with fewer customers seeking agent-assisted channels.\nWhen it comes to age, non-Millennials (ages 35+) are 5 to 7 percent more likely to seek a traditional service channel\u2014phone, email, in-person, chat or self-help\u2013whereas a Millennial is 5 to 6 percent more likely to use a mobile or social media\nplatform for customer service. Knowing your audience is step one to establishing the roadmap for self-service automation.\nLaunch your self-service engagement strategy early on, leveraging your customers\u2019 profiles. Let this drive your decisions regarding how, when and where to market and engage customers on the available self-service channel options. After all, you\nwant to bring the greatest value\u2013targeting the right interaction solution for the right customer.\nStep 2: Revisit Customer DataTake a look at what you already know about your customers and their habits. Investigate who is repeatedly calling and why. Is the solution they seek available in a self-service channel? For example \u2013 are they calling for password resets, package\ntracking, balance checking or updating personal account details? If the task generated by the customer inquiry requires a relatively low level of abstract thinking or autonomous problem solving, then it is more suitable for automation.\nThen, analyze how many callers are currently using self-service channels and when. Are the self-service solutions robust enough? Are they geared toward the right transaction or customer base? Is there a defect in the process resulting in a false sense\nof resolution?\nWhile originally designed for repeat contact reduction, the same steps work for all contacts. Identify contact reasons, develop solutions, check in to see that the plan is working and act to achieve lasting results. You now have a repeatable practice\nto take you through the customer lifecycle and remove waste from the customer experience.\nDrawing conclusions from the data you already have positions you for a meaningful conversation about where to go with the automation of your business processes.\nStill need help?

Unlike traditional mail services, the client\u2019s customers required agents to be able to answer inquiries regarding high-end medications, while also providing those\ncustomers new services for consideration. Consequently, the program needed agents trained in both inbound customer care and sales.\nAs they say in Gotham, when the Commissioner calls, you pick up. And we do.\nTHE SOLUTION\nAlorica designed a customer care and sales solution with the ability to meet the client\u2019s significant annual staffing fluctuations by doubling our workforce and adding several contact centers.\nThat\u2019s right. We doubled our workforce. That\u2019s just the kind of thing we do for our clients.

Furthermore, we implemented a proactive outreach for members impacted by plan design limitations,\nand created welcome calls as part of a member\u2019s engagement strategy. To do so, we analyzed landline leads, conducted profiling analytics and incorporated analytic customer heat maps in order to determine the best time of day and day of week\nin which to contact them. Finally, we identified members least likely to contact the client and proactively used alternative, low-cost channels to contact those members case-by-case.\nTHE RESULTS\nTop performer for increasing prescription conversions, per contact, by 10-15%\nConsistently a top performer among all of the client\u2019s internal contact centers\nSince implementing Alorica\u2019s custom program, the client has experienced a 6% increase on member scores and a 19% increase on provider scores\nClick above to download the full case study.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc_587", "title": "Burnout Stinks! Signs and Solutions to Prevent Call Center Burnout", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/burnout-stinks-signs-and-solutions-to-prevent-call-center-burnout\nBurnout Stinks! Signs and Solutions to Prevent Call Center Burnout\nShare this\nThe burnout syndrome is an epidemic. In fact, a study from Stanford University reported in the U.S. the cost for healthcare in support of burnout is about $190 billion with 120,000 deaths annually (Gallup Inc., 2017). Additionally, a recent survey found\nthat employee burnout is sabotaging workforce retention. Some of the top reasons mentioned in the study include unfair compensation (41%), unreasonable workload (32%), and too much overtime or after hours (32%). These facts are not portraying a pretty\npicture for the men and women in our organizations. It\u2019s clear that more and more people are getting burnout in the workplace and it\u2019s our job to try to understand it and find productive ways to reduce this syndrome (Wilkie, 2017).\nContact centers have become a vital part of global businesses. Companies in various industries have contact centers that employ millions of agents to serve as the primary customer-facing channel. According to the United States Department of Labor, customer\nservice representatives (CSR), or customer service agents, employment was projected to grow about 9.8% from 2014 to 2024. The national workforce is projected to only grow to 6.5%. As a comparison, we can see that CSR employment is growing faster than\nthe national workforce average. To effect lasting systemic change, it is critical to understand the factors leading to job burnout for millions of CSR employees around the world (Vizueta, 2014).\nWhat Exactly is Employee Burnout?The volume of daily work and the number of customer interactions overwhelms contact center employees, leaving 52% of customer service agents feeling that their company isn\u2019t doing enough to prevent burnout (Calabrio). Burnout has been defined as\n\u201ca syndrome of emotional exhaustion and cynicism that occurs frequently among individuals who do \u2018people work\u2019 of some kind\u201d (Jackson, 1981).\nIn the contact center world, burnout is one of the main reasons for turnover. The volume of daily work and the number of customer interactions overwhelm employees. According to a Toister study (Toister, 2016), agents want to deliver excellent\nservice in general. Burnout increases when agents believe their contact center is making it hard for them to accomplish this goal; however, their burnout risk decreases when agents feel their employer is supportive to their needs and its customers.\nAgents want to feel empowered to provide exceptional service.\nWhat Are Those Burnout Symptoms?Being a customer engagement expert is a high-pressure job. When facing multiple customers with numerous requests daily, with the expectation to create empathy, rapport and even trust, one can become very detached from their work. It\u2019s an uphill\nbattle to continually display positive emotions and to suppress negative ones in a complex contact center environment. Here are the top three burnout symptoms that normally appear in the workplace within the first year of employment (Jackson, 1981):\nIncreased Emotional Exhaustion: Agents feel that as their emotional resources are drained, they are no longer able to cope with issues on a psychological level.Cynicism Towards Customers: Agents are prone to negative and cynical attitudes towards customers. Maslach and Jackson concluded that the adverse reactions to a customer could be linked to the experience of emotional exhaustion.Professional Efficacy: \u201cThe tendency to evaluate oneself negatively, particularly regarding one\u2019s work with customers.\u201d In other words, when employees feel dissatisfied with their performance, the consequences can\nbe quite severe and detrimental to employees, their customers, and ultimately to the organization.\u00a0Solutions to Prevent Agent BurnoutIn my experience, burnout symptoms occur in organizations where employees feel undervalued and overworked. Trust is a significant component when it comes to understanding the key factors leading to emotional exhaustion, cynicism and professional efficacy.\nTo prevent or minimize burnout in contact centers an organization must:\n1. Avoid Favoritism: Treat people with respect and treat people fairly, without favoritism. The slightest perception of a manager favoring one person or group against another, will cause resentment and trust will not be achieved.2. Have Clear Values: Make sure that operational processes and the company\u2019s mission and vision statements are clear to all employees. When employees perceive a value conflict on the job, their engagement with work tends to decrease.3. Minimize Role Conflict and Role Ambiguity: Establish continued training around employee roles and processes. Employees should be encouraged to participate in decision-making processes to avoid conflict and ambiguity in the contact\ncenter environment.4. Understand the Contact Center Environment: Training or seminars can enhance the employee\u2019s capacity to cope with their workplace. The organization should not focus on changing the individual alone; instead, the organization\nshould start implementing some of these incremental changes within itself.Burnout is commonplace, and no one is immune to it. It\u2019s important to structure your work environment so that every manager and employee feels motivated and has the tools and support they need to succeed. At Alorica, we\u2019re focused\non creating insanely great customer interactions. It starts with providing a healthy work environment for our people, filled with a culture rooted in fun, encouragement and collaboration.

The association is overseen by venerated tech pioneers, legal experts, and professors, including former COOs of Mozilla and Heads of Policy from Pinterest, Facebook, and Twitter. TPSA offers a comprehensive overview into Trust & Safety, both as an industry and as a practice, including The Future of Trust & Safety, a review of new challenges presented by the continued evolution of technology and the pervasive nature of threats online. In the market overview, the TSPA defines several key areas of focus; as a leading Trust & Safety provider for ~15 years, our perspective offers a seasoned view on these trends. \u00a0Increased investments to keep users safeAs detailed by the TPSA, companies have been investing more in Trust & Safety, particularly over the past decade. Industries from nearly every niche are prioritizing online safety, from beefing up security to harnessing AI/NLP technology to streamline multi-media moderation efforts. For online platforms and eCommerce websites, keeping users safe is a top priority\u2014safeguarding against bad actors, fraud, and malicious content is essential to bottom lines\u2014requiring constant oversight and action in an ever-changing landscape.Keeping ahead of the curve is essential for successful content moderation, as well as anticipating client needs. Investing heavily in leading-edge technology and top-tier talent, partnering with third-party technology developers, and working with diverse, global Trust & Safety teams gives companies an advantage against online threats. And we couldn\u2019t agree more; our many investments include implementing proprietary and third-party tools to streamline multilingual, multi-media content moderation, speed up collaboration and information flow, and enhance training, coaching, and retention. \u00a0But, in our experience, we\u2019ve found that it\u2019s just as important to take care of your frontline content moderators, those intrepid individuals staring down online threats day after day. Caring for our people is a bedrock principle at Alorica; digital, gamified apps and to assess engagement and mood, ongoing wellness coaching and training, as well as anytime access to licensed mental health professionals, keep our content moderators going strong. \u00a0Proactive and protective effortsAs bad actors and cybercriminals become increasingly sophisticated, cybersecurity strategies continually evolve to meet new threats. A highlight of the TPSA report is the importance of keeping customers and clients safe online; this requires a deep understanding of the different ways users can be harmed, as well as how they act with online platforms.\u00a0 Successful Trust & Safety efforts adapt to policy changes, keeping both clients and content moderators up-to-date about what threats are out there\u2014and what can be done about them. We\u2019ve found deep analytics to be absolutely invaluable for illuminating user behavior, as well as isolating known threats.To best support the needs and requirements of leading global brands, Alorica\u2019s approach relies on a combination of data-driven analytics, a nimble and scalable worldwide workforce, proprietary technology, and training models to ensure content moderation is always accurate, expedient, and based on intent, local context, current events, and community guidelines. \u00a0Keeping in lockstep with new legislation and regulationsWhat\u2019s online has been influencing everything from public policy to fashion trends for over a quarter century, and how people communicate in online spaces has become increasingly important to everyone from governments, corporations, and organizations to individuals. As the TPSA advises, free expression is vital to online communities, but companies and countries often have to grapple with what\u2019s said and spread online without existing guidelines, creating new policies quickly because users expect the platforms they use to be safe and secure at all times. In practice, we\u2019ve found that it\u2019s essential to keep up with corporate policies and regulatory changes, and continually educate all Trust & Safety specialists, including content moderators, as well as proactively prepare for changing requirements. \u00a0Ready to learn more?Visit our\u00a0Content Moderation\u00a0solutions page to see how Alorica can help you create Trust & Safety centers of excellence within your business.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

A Hiring Analytics Case Study", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/weve-got-their-back-ups-a-hiring-analytics-case-study\nWe've Got Their Back (Up's)! A Hiring Analytics Case Study\nDownload\nShare this\nThe client\u2014a security software company\u2014required a very specific agent profile to provide world-class technical support to their highly-knowledgeable customer base.\u00a0After a complete assessment, we concluded that our proprietary hiring\nanalytics platform would play a key role in sourcing the right talent for this nearshore operation.\nDownload our We've Got Their Back (Up's)! A Hiring Analytics Case Study\u00a0to learn more.\nTHE CHALLENGE\nLaunch a nearshore operation\u2014close to the client\u2019s home-base, and with agents who possess strong English-speaking skills\nIdentify, train and deploy a team of qualified agents to handle chat and email channels\nDemonstrate success in the first wave, and prepare for a larger deployment\nTHE OUTCOME\nUsing hiring analytics and advanced agent profiling, 100% of chat/email applicants that were hired graduated training and passed rigorous client clearance QA processes with flying colors\nCSAT scores jumped by 73%; performing 10% higher vs. client\u2019s in-house team\nWe anticipate 150% growth with the client\nTHE CHALLENGE\nStarting Small and Thinking Big.\nHandling chat and email channels can be more complicated than voice-based technical support work, so finding a team of qualified agents presented as a unique test. The client discovered this first-hand, as their existing team couldn\u2019t run concurrent\nchats and made missteps\u2014and simply didn\u2019t have the bandwidth to support everything at once. Shortly after launching our program, we successfully migrated the first wave of voice-support agents over to chat and email\u2014and buoyed by\ntheir success, prepared to expand.\nTHE SOLUTION\nMultitasking to the Rescue!\nOur agents in this program are in a totally different kind of position; they not only need to be proficient in tech support but have to be able to toggle between multiple conversations at once. Our proprietary hiring analytics platform played a key role\nin sourcing the right talent; this technology allowed us to construct the ideal agent profile, and we used the platform to screen candidates for their multitasking abilities, ultimately hiring agents best suited for the complex, multi-channel work.\nThe new, Jamaica-based team quickly exceeded expectations in both customer satisfaction (CSAT) and overall Quality Assurance (QA). Coupled with cutting down Average Handle Time (AHT) and the cost savings this nearshore location offered, the client\nwas thrilled\nTHE OUTCOME\nEver-expanding Opportunities.\nThanks to the success of the program, we continue to absorb more volume from the client, and we are currently exploring ways to expand lines of business. We began with just a few agents in this multi-channel support role, and we\u2019re on pace to more\nthan quadruple the number of agents by the end of 2019. We estimate that that once the team is fully up to speed, we\u2019ll average up to two concurrent chats at all times\u2014and we\u2019re pretty darn proud of that\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

UNREAL CIRCUMSTANCES. UNMATCHED RESULTS.\nAlorica has provided work-at-home (WAH) solutions for more than 17 years. So when COVID-19 struck, and a leading telecommunications provider made the decision to shift 100% of their workforce to a virtual model, this wasn\u2019t our first WAH rodeo.\nFar from it. In this instance, we were already overseeing a small but highly-capable work-at-home team for the client. The programs we had established and the practices already implemented would prove enormously valuable, as we worked to migrate the\nclient\u2019s entire program (thousands of agents) to a work-at-home environment\u2014in only a few weeks. The outcome was transformative\u2014and has positioned us for greater flexibility in the future. But we\u2019ll get to all that.\nTHE RESULTS\nAttrition for work-at-home agents was 15% lower than brick-and-mortar (B&M) agents in the same program\nCustomers rated their experiences 7% higher with WAH agents as compared to B&M employees\nAHT was an average 34 points lower for WAH agents than B&M\nContact Resolution was rated 3% higher in WAH agents\nTHE CHALLENGE\nExperience when it mattered most.\nPrior to COVID-19, all agents were required to meet rigorous requirements for the program\u2014including working in a brick-and-mortar setting for at least 90 days and meeting or exceeding Key Performance Indicator (KPI) metrics; this helped ensure that\nagents working at home would be able to handle the rigors of the role and adapt to 100% virtual onboarding, training and production support. When federal and state mandates necessitated a total migration to a work-at-home customer experience outsourcing\nmodel, the client already had a strong blueprint in place. With documented success in the existing WAH agent group, our client was well-positioned when the decision was made to shift all employees to work-at-home. Still, moving that many agents in\nsuch a short timeframe\u2014and against the backdrop of COVID-19\u2014was no small order\nTHE SOLUTION\nBest practices for a best-in-class result.\nTime was of the essence, and we had none to lose. Fortunately, our experienced work-at-home workforce helped the brick-and-mortar team get up and running quickly and efficiently.\nExisting best practices were deployed to the newly-transitioned agents, and as they adjusted to their new at-home environment, we closed the performance gap and established effective routines for both agents and leadership. These routines were grounded\nin a continued commitment to rigorous security and compliance standards, two-way virtual agent communication, collaboration and top-notch leadership support\u2014and were a vital component of previous and ongoing success.\nTHE OUTCOME\nLeveraging the past and looking to the future.\nSeveral months into the new normal, the client\u2019s work-at-home teams consistently outperform their legacy B&M counterparts in key metrics. Today, as regulations slowly allow\nemployees to return on-site, a hub-and-spoke model is being used; agents are acquiring skills in a B&M environment, before \u2018graduating\u2019 to WAH when and if circumstances dictate In fact, our success with the program has earned us a\nbest-in-class reputation\u2014against which now benchmark agent performance.\nIt\u2019s an unpredictable world out there\u2014and preparedness and confidence in a solution goes a long way.\nABOUT ALORICA\nAlorica is a global leader in customer experience solutions.

Knowledgebase content aids a customer in an online self-service environment or through an interactive voice response system\n(IVR). It\u2019s a critical component of self-service, designed to empower the customer through the resolution process.\nIn a time of information overload, it\u2019s important to keep information accessible, current and accurate. This makes it easier for customers to find resolutions for their problems. According to Salesforce, 75% of consumers say that say it is important\nto be able to interact with a company on their personal schedule.1\nFollow these four steps to ensure the knowledgebase you create for your customers drives resolution and increases overall satisfaction. After all, the best way to gain loyalty from your customers is by making it easy for them to do business with you.\nIdentify Where Your Customers Can Self-Serve\nAs you build your customer knowledgebase, the first step is identifying possible scenarios or problems that are easy to resolve using self-help troubleshooting.\nSome examples include:\nSetting up an account\nResetting a password\nAccessing an account\nReinstating service\nAdding services to the account\nThis is also the time to think about Help Access Points (or HAPs).\u00a0 HAPs help you to identify where the customer is when the need for help arises.\u00a0 Your strategy for how to design and deliver customer facing service content would be impacted\nby the HAPs identified.\u00a0 A key to delivering an effortless experience is serving the right content to the customer at the exact time and place where help is needed.\nA recent study by Groove HD found that 71% of customers who encounter great response times are recommending that specific brand.2\u00a0As you think through potential reasons a customer would need support, keep in mind the customer lifecycle\nof your product or service and identify the possible scenarios from each phase.\nCreate the Self-Service Content\nNow that you\u2019ve compiled the list of potential customer issues, it\u2019s time to roll up your sleeves and create a knowledgebase article explaining the resolution for each of those potential customer issues.\nThe first step is to design your knowledgebase approach. Two popular approaches are a decision tree and a process map.\nA decision tree guides the customer through a step-by-step process and branches out depending on what occurs at each step.\nA process document creates a series of steps and diagrams to aid a customer through resolving an issue.\nWhen you create content outlining the troubleshooting steps, it\u2019s important that you think about how this content will work in a self-service vs. agent-assisted customer support environment. For example, when you are guiding a customer through self-help,\nit\u2019s best to include screen shots and other imagery to allow the customer to read and visualize the steps for resolution.\nIt is important that the content designed is easy to understand and flows smoothly.\u00a0 Resolving a customer\u2019s issue through self-service doesn\u2019t need to be complex.\u00a0 In a recent article, Gartner states that organizations often have\nvery complex content/information architecture and service-case workflows. This makes it difficult for your customers to find relevant information quickly. The rapid creation and retrieval of relevant content and knowledge are key attributes of leading\nenterprises.\n3\nDeveloping content is time consuming and the more you can leverage the content from one article for both self-service and contact center support, the less content management you will need post-deployment.\nUnderstand How Often Your Content is Being Used\nIn any business, measurement is key to understanding where you are doing well and where you have opportunities to drive improvement. The same concept applies to your knowledgebase.\u00a0 To measure the effectiveness of your content, you need to understand\nhow often an article is being used and if the article resolved the customer\u2019s issue.\nIn a self-service environment, you can include a question\u2014Did this information resolve your issue? \u2014after the customer completes the troubleshooting steps.\nIn a contact center environment, the agent can ask the question, or you can collect the data through a follow-up customer satisfaction survey.\nIn addition to understanding whether or not the article resolved the customer\u2019s issue, it\u2019s also important to understand and monitor what key words customers and support representatives use for searches. This insight will help you optimize\nyour search functionality and your content management strategy.\nMaintain Your Self-Service Content\nA knowledgebase is only effective if the content is current and there is a defined process in place to manage updates. If content is not maintained appropriately, it increases the effort required by your customers as they search through large quantities\nof content that may or may not be accurate. This may result negatively on customer satisfaction and prompt an unnecessary increase in call volumes.\nEven further, too much content about the same topic or outdated content that no longer contains accurate steps for resolution can greatly the impact the way your customer views your brand.\u00a0 Oracle has found that 55% of customers commit to a brand\nbecause of the ability to easily find the information or help they need.4\nYou must have the right information available for self-service and the contact center, but content management will ultimately drive your success.\nTo be successful at content management, define a process to update your knowledgebase.\nEstablish a frequency for all articles to be reviewed and updated.\nMaintain an inventory of all articles with publish dates.\nUpdate the key search words based on current content available.\nRemove articles that are outdated or no longer accurate. Make sure that any article rewrites replace the original articles.\nThe support environment is always changing. We know tech savvy customers want the ability to resolve their issue before contacting support. Self-service resources allow your customers to solve their own issues in a way that\u2019s fast and easy. A study\nby Ganter predicts that by 2020, 85% of customer relationships will be managed without the customer ever needing to interact with another person.5\nIn this DIY era, offering self-service is a necessity. It shows you are listening and understand the way your customers want to be served. Meanwhile, it deflects unnecessary call volumes thereby reducing your overall cost per transaction. Using an effective\nknowledgebase content plan to deliver an effortless self-service experience compliments customer support and provides the customer multiple ways to resolve their issue. When done effectively, this drives improvement in the overall customer experience\nand improves how customers feel about your brand.\nSOURCES:\nhttps://www.livehelpnow.net/blog/live-chat-apps-statistics-improve-customer-service/\nhttp://customerthink.com/why-quick-response-time-personalization-and-problem-resolution-matter-in-providing-quality-social-media-customer-care/\nGartner, \u201cDelivering Relevant Content and Knowledge to Customers Is Key to Great Customer Service,\u201d May 9, 2017\u00a0https://www.gartner.com/document/3708917\nhttps://herothemes.com/blog/improving-customer-service-knowledge-base/\nhttps://solvvy.com/blog/self-service-future-customer-support/\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

She wanted to work with people because building relationships was her passion. So, it\u2019s no surprise\nthat a job in recruiting was her next step. \u00a0 With a background in temporary staffing, employment management in the hotel industry, and corporate recruiting, her role at Alorica has allowed her to meld her two strengths together: managing teams and matching individuals with the right job opportunities.\nShe has found success by truly believing in what she\u2019s doing and looking at challenges as obstacle courses that you can overcome. Read Karly\u2019s full Q&A below:\nQ: What gets you up in the morning?A: Knowing that I have a direct impact on really pleasing our customers and our clients and growing Alorica. Every day we have hundreds of\nagents starting in our organization. I love doing what I do because I know I am making a difference, and I add the human touch into it. When I am visiting sites and I see the family feel and see people connecting to others, I love knowing that people\nare making long-lasting relationships at work.\nQ: What are the key ways that you approach challenges in your day to day work?A:  I\u2019m a visual type of person. What I tell anybody if they come to me and ask for advice\nis, \u201cokay, list the obstacles, and now let\u2019s talk about how we will go about removing those obstacles.\u201d Then we can follow up and talk about what is still an obstacle. After you\u2019ve gotten through your obstacle course, it\u2019s\nhelpful to go back and, in your mind, list the obstacles you went through and how you overcame them and fixed them.\nQ: How do you view mentorship in the workplace?A:  I advanced in my career because mentors set great examples. In my first job out of college, I absorbed everything like a sponge.\nWhether they knew it or not, there were people who I looked at for inspiration. Their actions helped me learn and grow. Today, I find mentors everywhere--they are the people that leave me thinking after a phone call. They get my mind turning, help\nme understand challenges, and get me thinking about how I can take control of what I can control. \u00a0Q: What motivated you in pursuing this career path?A: I wanted to be on the positive side of a business and to connect with people. In recruiting, you\u2019re always giving\ngood news. \u201cYou got a job! Congratulations!\u201d If I can go to bed at night thinking to myself, \u201cToday, I placed 30 people in positions, I know they\u2019re excited and I\u2019m excited.\u201d That was my drive for choosing my own\njob roles throughout my career. \u00a0Q: Did you have a specific career plan that led to your current role at Alorica?A: For me, it hasn\u2019t necessarily been about making a long-term career plan. An opportunity\ncame up a year ago which allowed me to continue to find jobs for people as a Sr. Director of Talent Acquisition. It helped get me back into managing people, an area in which I am also passionate about.

Illustrating\nthis point beautifully is this month\u2019s Alorican in Action, VP of Client Solutions, Beverley Bridges. Read Beverley\u2019s Q&A below to explore her unique 13-year career at Alorica (and counting), and advice for succeeding on your own path.\nQ: Did you have a plan to reach an executive-level position?A: I\u2019d like to say that I strategically orchestrated my career every step of the way, but that would be a lie.\nBeing successful has meant always doing my best, recognizing that I am responsible for the choices that I make, and treating people how I want them to treat me. I believe that diversity is what makes us great, so I like to bring my perspective to\nsituations and encourage others to do so as well.\nQ: Did you ever work with a mentor, and did that process help you?A: I have a lot of mentors\u2014and most of them don\u2019t even know I see them that way! My philosophy\nis that the life you live speaks louder than the words you say. Mentors have been both colleagues and people I know outside of work\u2014almost everyone has taught me something.Q: What advice would you give about climbing the career ladder?A: Know your value. If you don\u2019t know it, nobody else will. Also, lift others as you climb and don\u2019t\ngive up or give in if your career track isn\u2019t going as you imagined\u2014resiliency is a great skill to master. Lastly, don\u2019t burn bridges. You never know when you might want to lean on an old colleague for advice or a fresh point of\nview.\nQ: What is your advice on how to make meaningful connections?A: My grandmother and mother always said, \u201cget in where you fit in.\u201d Through my regular one-on-one meetings\nwith each of my clients, I try to find commonalities; it doesn\u2019t have to be about work, but perhaps family, hobbies, upcoming events or whatever is important to each of us. Connecting with people is how you build trust and respect.\nQ: What excites you most about what you do? A: Taking on new challenges. The hurdles are exciting, and once you get to the other side of it, you can say, \u201cthis is what\nwe did.\u201d What also brings me joy is keeping people motivated. I think it\u2019s very important as women that we know who has our back and is invested in seeing us grow and move upward. Surround yourself with people who share your goals and\nobjectives, and are willing to have courageous conversations with you when you get off track. You may not always like what they have to say, but as women, authentic relationships are critical.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

Armed with a master\u2019s degree in philosophy, this Director of Client Solutions uses deep analysis to uncover the root causes of an issue and\nto help guide her to a solution.Pency started out as an agent and has since held positions in quality, training and operations management. She believes change can be scary, but it\u2019s also good. Read her full Q&A below.\nWhat professional advice has helped you in your career? Early on, I was trying to fit into the mold of what I thought a young, strong black woman in corporate America was supposed to be like. I have a really big\npersonality, I\u2019m very opinionated and I can come off a little harsh sometimes, but I was silencing myself. Then Colleen Beers gave me the best advice: she said to \u201cbe Pency.\u201d That really freed me up to come into my own.\nLooking back, do you regret any career moves you did or didn\u2019t make? Once Andy Lee visited our site and asked what we could do to improve, but I didn\u2019t speak up because I didn\u2019t want to come\noff as a know-it-all or be a troublemaker. I wasn\u2019t being Pency! I really regret not using my voice when I had the opportunity, but I don\u2019t hold back anymore.\nHow can we all continue to better ourselves at work? Our success is dependent upon each other, so see what you can do to improve. Take every class and attend every conference that\u2019s offered to you. Last\nyear I attended COPC certification training, and it was my most eye-opening experience ever, both personally and professionally.\nWhat does it take to build lasting relationships with colleagues, clients and other contacts? A lot of people have difficulty delivering bad news, especially to clients, but my main thing is honest communication.\nI won\u2019t sugarcoat it, I\u2019ll just say it. And if it can be fixed, they know that I\u2019ll roll up my sleeves and dig in.What is your advice on how to make meaningful connections? Be honest. Let your personality come through, and don\u2019t be afraid to be vulnerable. A meaningful connection comes when you are who you are to someone,\nand they\u2019re who they are to you.

{"_id": "doc_614", "title": "10 Tech Executives Share Marketing Trends And Predictions For 2021", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/10-tech-executives-share-marketing-trends-and-predictions-for-2021\n10 Tech Executives Share Marketing Trends And Predictions For 2021\nShare this\nWhat\u2019s on the horizon for marketers this year? To find out, I sought insight from the following nine tech executives .\nWe will see fundamental shifts in how organizations approach B2B marketing. Juliette Rizkallah, Chief Marketing Officer, SailPoint\n\u201cStandard marketing models will begin to emulate more aggressive and digitally focused B2C marketing approaches, where companies leverage a variety of digital touchpoints to target an individual buyer. B2B marketing will need to adjust the B2C approaches\nto handle the multi-personae account buying committee and will leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to measure the progression of accounts along the top of the funnel. The second shift will surround events and the role they play in\nthat funnel. Once largely used for high-level awareness, virtual or physical events in 2021 will instead move further down in the funnel and become more targeted to initiate engagement with accounts already active and showing commercial intent.\u201d\nIn terms of digital fluency, marketers are years ahead of where anyone thought we\u2019d be going into 2021. Alicia Tillman, Global Chief Marketing Officer at SAP\n\u201cThe technology, the tactics, the flexible mindset \u2013 with these tools, disruption is no longer the showstopper it once was. As the world moves forward day by day, marketers are more prepared than ever to be agile and deliver the experiences\naudiences need, when they need them. Rather than months-long marketing campaigns, brand marketing will more closely mirror the way we\u2019re living our lives as individuals. In the moment, deeply empathetic, and tuned into each other\u2019s needs.\u201d\nWe will see a stark divide in an organization\u2019s marketing budget spend, followed by consequential impact. Jim Kruger, Chief Marketing Officer, Veeam\n\u201cWith the unstable economy projected to carry into the new year, there will be a resulting stark divide in marketing budget spend. On one end, companies will look to cut back on marketing budgets because they see it as a variable cost that can be\nmanaged up or down fairly easily. On the other end, companies will increase investment in marketing because they see driving demand and building the brand as top priorities. Looking ahead, those organizations pivoting funds away from marketing will\nultimately endure longer term impacts. Marketing takes quite some time to build on, and by toggling budgets up and down, past investments will begin to lose momentum. A dip in marketing spend will put these companies well behind others who continue\nto invest. Those who choose to navigate through this uncertainty and prepare for recovery will be far more successful in the long run.\u201d\nVerifying human engagement will be critical for marketer leaders. Dan Lowden, Chief Marketing Officer, White Ops\n\u201cIn 2021, marketing leaders will be able to confidently verify engagement with real humans as they increasingly become more aware of how sophisticated bots and fraud are infiltrating their marketing spend. Marketers will partner with specialists\nthat can help them accurately gauge if their campaigns are targeting real humans \u2013 resulting in better customer experience, ensuring higher engagement, bringing visibility to cleaner data, improving the company's compliance position and driving\nstronger ROI across marketing campaigns. Marketers will be given a more critical seat at the executive table because of these insights and actions that help grow the business while ensuring every marketing dollar is effectively spent.\u201d\nRecent privacy regulations have given license for walled gardens to raise their walls even higher.Abhay Singhal, CEO, InMobi Marketing Cloud\n\u201cThis is an extremely uncertain period of time, and CMOs shouldn\u2019t have one roadmap \u2013 they should have multiple. For starters, marketing teams will need to be prepared to make the case for why consumers should opt in to data sharing\nwithin the app. On the flip side, marketers should also be prepared to potentially not have access to that data and will need to find alternative solutions or tactics to create as much of a consistent ID as possible. Without this, advertisers are\nat risk of presenting the same ads to consumers over and over, which compromises brand image and user experience. Having contingency plans for both scenarios will be critical, and marketers need to start setting expectations and redefining metrics\nas soon as possible.\u201d\nCompany culture will play an even bigger role in recruiting great marketing talent. Amanda Bohne, Chief Marketing Officer at AppNeta\n\u201cNow that so many companies have proven that, for many, remote work can be as effective as in-office work, it will be hard for businesses to return to the old ways of doing things if they want to continue to recruit top talent. Top marketers will\nnow be sought after by companies located across the country, enabling them to potentially live somewhere different or more affordable than where their current employer is located. Trying to recruit for a company where in-office work is mandated will\nstart to meaningfully impact your candidate pool, and therefore your ability to attract the best talent.\u201d\nNo matter what product you sell, what you need to market is trust. Dale Renner CEO, Co-Founder, RedPoint Global\n\u201cConsumers want trust in the product quality, trust in the organization handling your data, trust that the organization is doing what is right for the environment and social needs, trust that the organization knows and values you. Trust is ultimately\ndriven through a series of interactions \u2013 those brands that are responsible with a consumer\u2019s data and use it to create value for the consumer, those that provide consistent experiences, those that operate at the consumer\u2019s cadence\nwill build that trust. Brands unable to be trustworthy, will experience a dramatic decline in customer loyalty and brand value.\u202f\u201d\nB2B marketers will primarily focus on strengthening relationships with existing customers. Elena Filimonova, SVP, Marketing CGS\n\u201cMarketers will evaluate their customer base to provide them with unused benefits of their service, while building out business opportunities for the future. By sharing best practices and tips for leveraging existing services with valued customers,\nMarketers will ensure long-term loyalty with their companies as these customers may be struggling in the current environment.\u201d\nGoogle and Apple have led the industry-wide clapback for transparency and data privacy. Susan Lee, Chief Product Officer, Valassis\n\u201cIn the new year, it\u2019s reasonable to assume other tech companies will put similar measures in place to further reduce user signals. Fewer precise data points from cookies and mobile device IDs means marketers will engage fewer consumers on\na one-to-one or known basis. Instead, marketing teams will need to leverage advanced machine learning models and other probabilistic techniques to reach high-value audiences who look like your known customer base, maximizing scale.\u201d\nOmnipresent CX will be a game changer in defining brand loyalty. Colson Hillier, Chief Marketing Officer, Alorica Inc.\n\u201cIn today\u2019s 'continuously-connected' way of life, it\u2019s not enough that brands respond to customers through multiple channels. Consumers crave effortless CX\u2014being able to alternate quickly from different platforms, but for these channels to also be personalized, persistent and effective in solving pain points in the user experience. In 2021, you\u2019ll\nsee more companies stay one step (or maybe even five!) ahead of customers\u2019 wants through advanced analytics and embedded intelligence, which in turn creates more contextual and meaningful interactions that allow brands to market, sell and serve\ntheir customers better and faster. When brands proactively \u2018push\u2019 tailored experiences rather than rely on customers to \u2018pull\u2019 from services after they\u2019ve had a problem, that changes the nature of the relationship, offering\ninsights for marketing teams to better evaluate evolving consumer preferences. The convergence of always-connected consumers, new platforms for service delivery and permissioned data provides the insights, context and channels that ultimately redefine\nbrand loyalty.\u201d\nThe article was originally published on Forbes.com at http://bit.ly/38xESeW\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

According to Gartner, the customers willing to complete a survey fall into the extremes of very happy and very upset. This creates a data set that\nomits the thoughts and opinions of the average customer and leads to decisions that are not tailored to the majority of the company\u2019s customers.1\nTo gather opinions from customers that will provide the useful insight businesses\ncrave, it is essential to ask for feedback in channels where the majority of your customers operate, which leads to our next point.\n2. Keep customers from saying, \u2018No way, survey!\u2019\nSurveys with too many questions or poorly constructed answer options will likely result in your user quitting the survey part way through, and they will be less inclined to answer future surveys.2\nBusinesses who are focusing on\nhow to best gather the sentiment of their consumer base need to understand the ways that they like to communicate, and tailor the channels utilized accordingly.\n3. Ask the right questions.\nSeveral companies fall into the trap of asking the standard experience/agent satisfaction questions. These general questions don\u2019t always provide insightful feedback that can be used to improve a business.\nSurvey Monkey suggests that\ncompanies define clear and attainable goals. Identifying what success looks like for your organization\u2014and making sure that you are asking the questions that provide you with insights\u2014is what will help you reach your goals.3\u00a0Think\nabout what you are trying to accomplish. Are you hoping to gain insight into how to improve agent performance, customer loyalty to your brand, or both? Answer these questions, and you will know the questions to ask.\n4. Keep the survey relevant.\nGainsight Go indicates that sending a survey devoid of personality and lacking any incentive are two major factors in whether a customer even decides to complete it. The decision to engage depends on how the request arrives. 4\nTraditional channels can be altered in ways to keep them relevant and convenient. An option to drive survey engagement is proximity marketing technology. In a consumer study by beacon platform Swirl,*\u00a0over 70% of shoppers who received beacon-triggered content and offers said it made them more likely to make a purchase during a store visit.5\nDon\u2019t be afraid to be bold when considering options!\n5. Show the value.\nCustomers are more likely to tell you what they think if they have seen the impact of past feedback on a product or experience. Don\u2019t just ask questions if the answers will disappear into a black hole. Show customers a direct correlation\nbetween feedback and improved service. This can come in the form of one-to-one feedback (i.e. a supervisor reaching out to an unsatisfied customer to rectify the situation) but can also be done effectively by trumpeting improvements made to products/services\nbased on direct customer feedback.\n6. Use the data available to you.\nMost businesses already have a considerable amount of customer interaction data that they can use to understand sentiment. This data will likely provide more true insight than any survey could. Text and voice analytics solutions can be used to\nanalyze interaction transcripts, providing companies with valuable insight into how their customers view several different aspects of their business\u2014products, support service options and agent interactions to name a few.\nThis list doesn\u2019t\ncover everything to consider for your customer feedback gathering strategy, but it is a starting point.

In retail, an omnichannel contact strategy provides customers with a seamless shopping experience, whether they\u2019re shopping online\nfrom a desktop or mobile device, by telephone or in a brick-and-mortar store.1\nIn the contact center industry, omnichannel represents a unified experience from one support channel to the next. Before reaching out to customer service, 66% of consumers explore prices online before heading to the store.2\u00a0By the time\nthey connect with a contact center, customers expect the care representative to understand what steps they have already taken. They also expect human ability to solve their challenges better than a machine or online community; otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t\nbe calling to begin with.\nConsider your smartphone. It remembers previous searches and builds a profile for you, pushing relevant content based on your history. Customers expect the same sort of history to be available when reaching out to their favorite brands. They want to be\nrecognized, not caught in the cycle of repeating themselves only to learn that their customer service agent either cannot solve the issue better than the app could, or worse, doesn\u2019t possess the baseline capabilities the app does. It\u2019s\ncrucial to have a solution that brings it all together in a meaningful way that doesn\u2019t add significant length to the interaction.\nMany companies are making heavy investments in customer-facing digital technology, but oftentimes, integration with the contact center software is overlooked, resulting in a multichannel solution that doesn\u2019t allow for the continuous experience\nof true omnichannel excellence. In many cases, multiple systems are still required to achieve one result. Without proper redesign and integration, what\u2019s left is a solution that causes more harm than good, leaving the burden on the contact center\nagent to resolve a complicated case.\nAs you create a list of what is important to you in an omnichannel tool, look at your existing infrastructure to determine if you\u2019re ready for the leap. Ask yourself the following three questions to best position yourself for success.\n1. System consolidation:\nHow many front-end and back-end systems are contact center agents currently using to research customer accounts and case history?\nIf the answer is more than one, it\u2019s a good idea to consolidate the existing systems prior to integrating with digital technology. Multiple systems lead to increased customer effort and longer resolution times. Remember, the more history the front\nline is armed with, the more intuitive and streamlined a CRM system should be for an exceptional customer experience.\n2. Multichannel platform integration:\nDoes your CRM platform interface well with web-based technology, and are you capturing the customer touchpoints at the self-service stage?\nIf the answer is no, either prioritize a facelift of the existing system or consider using a system integrator to bring the various channels together. When customers begin interacting via app, web, social media, and AI, the details of these touches must\npush to the front line for a cohesive experience and customer response. With important customer journey details in one platform, you can arm your care team with the necessary history for a truly robust and empowered customer experience.\n3. Employee experience considerations:\nNow that your most basic contacts are handled automatically, what is your strategy and budget for enhancing the more complex task skills of your front-line agents?\nAs employee expectations become more complex, training investments will be critical to ongoing success. Consider what concepts, such as routine system changes, can be easily adopted through online content delivery. While even the best Learning Management\nSystem will not replace the need for facilitator-led content, moving simple content to employee self-service can certainly augment the facilitator efforts. This leaves time and space for more in-depth strategy and procedural changes to be delivered\nlive in a classroom environment.\nAs you pave the way for front-line employees to take on additional responsibilities, make sure your compensation and efficiency expectations align with the skill set required. The new call types will require additional expertise and research time,\nespecially tasks previously handled by a Tier 2 agent. As skill requirements gain complexity, you will invest in agents\u2019 knowledge and adjust compensation to align accordingly with the heightened expectations and to prevent employee pool\nburnout. This will also ensure you are attracting the right level of talent for the job. With self-service channels resulting in reduced contact volume, the funding to provide necessary compensation adjustments should be readily available.\nWith awareness and attention to these crucial details for a seamless integration, you can confidently forge onward in your quest for automation. Developing a framework to address these three critical areas will help you avoid common pitfalls, leading\nto true omnichannel leadership. \u00a0 Interested in learning more?

Listed here are just a few of the advantages the Philippines offers to multinational enterprises:\nAccess to Global TalentCommunication SkillsInfrastructureInnovative TechnologyWhat Company Delivers Promises to Deliver \u201cInsanely Great\u201d Customer Experiences?

{"_id": "doc_634", "title": "Increase Customer Satisfaction with Personalized Digital CX Banking Solutions", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/Increase-Customer-Satisfaction-with-Personalized-Digital-CX-Banking-Solutions\nIncrease Customer Satisfaction with Personalized Digital CX Banking Solutions\nAuthored By: Aimee Ford, SVP of New Logo Sales\u2014BFSI, Government & Utilities   \ufeff\nShare this\nPersonalized Digital Solutions + Seamless Customer Experiences = Higher CSAT, FCR and NPSHow to convert transactional interactions to long-term customer satisfaction in BFSI\nHere at Alorica\u2014a global Customer Experience (CX) provider\u2014I lead the efforts in engaging some of the most reputable financial institutions in the world to offer our customer support services as an extension of their business. One great question\nI get asked often from financial services executives is\u2014how should they integrate \u2018digital\u2019 in a meaningful way to earn customers\u2019 satisfaction, trust and long-term business? The reality is consumers expect personalized\nservice from the companies they do business with. And while for some industries, like retail, that\u2019s innately part of every brand\u2019s identity; for others, like the banking, financial services, and insurance sector (BFSI), giving customers\nthe digital experiences they want isn\u2019t so simple. Here are some of BFSI\u2019s challenges and the best ways to solve for them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Make It Personal\u00a0\u00a0Consumers, particularly in the wake of the pandemic, have grown accustomed to personalized services and access through a variety of different channels, elevating expectations for BFSI companies exponentially. Customers want to feel like their financial\ninstitutions know them\u2014especially since they have access to some of their most sensitive information. For many large institutions, the servicing options across product types are still siloed and that can cause additional frustration. As a personal\nexample, when I tried to open a savings account through the bank where I already have a credit card, the customer service department could not pull up my existing information because their systems were not integrated. This made me feel undervalued\nas their customer and irritated about unnecessarily having to provide basic information. Customized CX solutions, built on a solid foundation of big data analytics and AI/ML, along with system integration, can help create tailored product recommendations,\nsavings plans, and other banking services to move brands beyond impersonal or generalized interactions. As Boston Consulting Group shared:\n\u201cUltimately, if done well, personalization at scale can provide a direct route to lower rates of customer churn and higher sales. Conservatively speaking, it can lead to annual revenue uplifts of 10% for banks.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Give Them Options\u00a0In a banking research report released by Genesys and FT Longitude,\nfinancial institutions recognized as customer experience leaders are twice as likely to be available on the channel customers want when they want it (49% versus 25%). But while automation technology can often deliver more rapid responses, the need\nto keep customer information confidential has made fully embracing automation technology challenging for BFSI companies. Telephone support still outpaces digital channel adoption; and when customers have to use multiple channels to complete transactions,\nit can lead to even more frustration and a lower quality experience. There are times that the customer will want face-to-face interaction with their bank to talk through a significant investment and/or a challenging situation. The customer will want\nto be heard, discuss their options, and ask questions live with the expectation that a professional bank employee will guide them through the process. That\u2019s why balance and optionality are key.\u00a0Self-service options can inadvertently add complexity to what customers expect to be a simple process. Omnichannel solutions, enhanced self-service options, improved functionality across digital channels, and 24/7 live support can help reduce the friction,\nstreamline disparate outcomes, and make digital options easier for everyone.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Partnerships You Can Bank On\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As pointed out in McKinsey & Company\u2019s 2022 article: \u201cfor\nmany [banks], a key struggle is that customer information is housed in different ways across the business and stove piped within functions, preventing the bank from gaining a complete view of the customer,\u201d but by partnering with a CX expert\nwho knows how to deliver the right blend of people, processes, and technology, customers can get the personal experiences they want from the BFSI brands they do business with. Whether it\u2019s adding automation technology with a human touch that\ncan support multiple product types or creating seamless omnichannel experiences, an experienced partner with scale, security, compliance, and digital solutions built in, can ensure optimal digital CX at every interaction. \u00a0\u00a0Because ultimately, when customers feel like they are understood, and they can trust us\u2014especially with their finances\u2014 their financial institution\u2019s wallet share grows. A strategic CX partner who knows how to deliver people-first, flexible\nand secure solutions at scale across industries makes all the difference in earning LTV.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (IAOP) recently launched its long-awaited Social Responsibility in Outsourcing (SRO) Chapter with its inaugural webinar, \u201cThe Evolution of Socially Responsible Outsourcing: Relevant Now More Than Ever.\u201d Participating in the webinar, included Alorica\u2019s Chief Culture Officer Joyce Lee, along with representatives from other leading organizations including Facebook, Microsoft, Sprint and BSR.\nFor the webinar, Alorica represented service providers in the BPO industry, offering our take on the benefit and impact of a CSR program. Besides the obvious reasons that it\u2019s the right thing to do and our clients care about it, Alorica believes being socially responsible is \u201cjust good business.\u201d Being in the people-to-people business, our employees are truly our greatest assets, thus we pay attention to what attracts them, motivates them and keeps them. The result? We\u2019ve created a culture of giving back, connection and empowerment through our CSR programs.\nSo how do we do that? One way is through our partnership with Making Lives Better with Alorica (MLBA), a global non-profit dedicated to improving the lives of people in need around the world. Alorica employees lead the nearly 100 chapters worldwide, where they are empowered to support individuals, local organizations and communities that matter most to them. In less than four years, MLBA chapters have raised and distributed millions of dollars in grants and disaster relief, and our clients are noticing these efforts! One example is through our partnership with Intuit where we were selected to help with their latest impact sourcing project, establishing a Prosperity Hub in Bluefield, W. Va. This initiative will bring hundreds of jobs, providing locals with career opportunities and support through MLBA, with the end goal of helping the people there to help themselves and their own community.\nInterested in learning more about why CSR is important to Alorica?

A major car rental client had in place a member loyalty program for Small/Medium Business (SMB) accounts. The client sought to increase adoption of the loyalty program, and to improve the win-back of members\nwho hadn\u2019t used the loyalty program for more than six months. Enter Alorica. Cue the music.\nTHE PROGRAM\nPhase 1 of the solution involved utilizing Alorica\u2019s data scientists from the Alorica Center of Analytical Excellence (CAE) to build an effective sales coverage plan and digital sales strategy. A resulting welcome program (Scoring\nModel), comprised of targeted acquisitions and customer prospect/profiling, was thusly launched.\nPhase 2 implemented said Scoring Model (built by those alluring data scientists of ours) to win-back current loyalty program members.\nPhase 3 saw Alorica providing full account management of the client\u2019s loyalty program accounts with a focus on maintaining and increasing the client\u2019s profitability. Meanwhile, a sales CRM system and digital sales strategy\nintelligently evaluated existing customer accounts using predictive analytics. And our CAE came through in the clutch, delivering actionable insights and a comprehensive view of the end customer, resulting in an optimal contact strategy, increased\npositive customer experiences and higher revenues.\nTHE RESULTS\nThe revised Welcome Program increased loyalty activations by 20%, and annual transactions by 17%. Meanwhile, the win-back program increased usage by 37%, generating a profit of $10 million \u2013 130% of the client\u2019s goal.

Since college, she\u2019s navigated her way through different positions in various\nindustries, gaining valuable experience and meeting supportive contacts along the way. Now, as Alorica\u2019s Director of Sales Enablement, she and her remote team of six help Alorica grow by assembling strategic business proposals and developing compelling sales presentations. Read her full Q&A below.\nHow did you reach your career goal of becoming a director? After I originally applied for the director position, I was disheartened when an external person was hired instead. But I knew that I was still a vital\npart of the team, so I continued to remain positive and do my best as a proposal manager. Later when that director didn\u2019t work out, I was promoted when my skills and experience demonstrated that I\u2019d be a great fit. My \u201cstick-to-it-ness\u201d\npaid off!\nWhat do you find most rewarding in your role? Seeing my team\u2019s accomplishments through organized collaboration is so rewarding because we\u2019re always working with several different people. Being in this\ncentral position exposes us to all departments and many perspectives throughout the company, making it clear that it really does take a village to prepare each well-rounded proposal and presentation.Did you have any noteworthy mentors along the way who were impactful in some way? I would definitely say (now Alorica\u2019s Senior Director of Product Strategy) Holly Hanak-Weaver, who I reported to as a proposal\nmanager. She always showed a protectiveness over her team, while empowering them, too. I try to copy off her great leadership style\u2014we both want to see our people grow and be the best they can be.\nWhat\u2019s the best way to pave a fulfilling career path? At any job, it\u2019s very important to establish genuine friendships with people you can depend on and who can depend on you in return. Then as your\ncareer changes, you\u2019ll find that by maintaining a professional network, you\u2019ll always have connections available for referrals, advice and encouragement.\nAny additional advice for work life? Don\u2019t be intimidated; have confidence in yourself and your skills. Make yourself indispensable by being flexible and open to change. And roll with challenging\nsituations while keeping a positive attitude and your best interests in mind of how you want to see yourself in the long run.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

Before Genet and Lori met each other, they were living a parallel course. Both joined El Paso East as agents and they were equally determined to move up the ranks. As they progressed through their leadership journey, little\ndid they know\ntheir Alorica paths were about to come together \u2026\nLori\u2019s side of the story.\u201cWhen I was hired in 2014, I set a goal to become an Operations Manager in five years. I was so excited that in just a matter of months, I was offered a Team Manager position!\u201d Lori explained. She\nwas moving on up. \u00a0 And \u2026 her upcoming vacation was going to be even better knowing she was returning to her new role! She couldn\u2019t wait to get back to work and was eager to meet her new boss. Of course, she was a little nervous because, after all, first impressions\nare everything! \u00a0 When Lori returned to work, she was reassured that her new team had performed well in her absence \u2026 because her new boss was asked to skip her vacation to make sure of it. (Uh-oh!)And now, Genet\u2019s side of the story. It was 2014 and Genet was elated to be offered a promotion from Team Manager to Shift Manager. Her leadership dreams were coming true! Not only was she killing it at work, she also had a vacation\nplanned soon. \u00a0 Things were definitely going her way. \u00a0 Or so she thought. Genet was informed that the person who was replacing her as Team Manager, Ms. Lori Melendez, had already requested personal time off. Therefore, Genet, as Lori\u2019s new boss, needed to skip her own vacation! \u00a0Needless to say, Genet wasn\u2019t thrilled about this change of events. \u201cWho IS this Lori person? She\u2019s taking my team AND my vacation?!\u201d Genet exclaimed.\nUnexpected friendships are the best ones. \u201cGenet had to skip her vacation so I could take MINE!\u201d Lori was horrified. This is not the way she wanted to start things off with her new boss! \u00a0 Eventually, they were able to laugh about it. And they soon realized that together they were even better than they were individually. \u00a0 That\u2019s why, a few months later, when Genet received another promotion as Operations Manager for El Paso\u2019s Outbound Team, she immediately invited Lori to be her Team Manager. \u00a0 Not only did Genet and Lori successfully lead their team \u2026 they were ranked the #1 Outbound Team in Alorica. Because of their passion, performance and belief in limitless possibilities, they were eventually asked to oversee\nthe Inbound Team too. What a major undertaking! \u00a0 Now, four years later, Genet and Lori are inseparable. Genet is leading the Inbound Team as Operations Manager. Lori achieved her goal as the Operations Manager of Outbound. And both departments are #1. \u00a0 Way to go, Lori and Genet!

It\u2019s leaders who play the most pivotal role in driving an organization\u2019s success because a good leader can be a key reason why an employee joins, stays at or leaves a company. Below are a few strategies that I have found to be vital in establishing a work environment where employees thrive:\u00a01. Cultivate a culture of accountability:Recognizing that mistakes are an inevitable part of the development process fosters a learning-oriented environment rather than one solely focused on results. Encouraging employees to acknowledge their errors and learn from them not only enables them to feel like they can try new or hard things, but also helps boost employee satisfaction and confidence. #BeBold\u00a02. Lead by example:By taking the time to walk your employees through your thought process and actions for a project or challenge, they\u2019re able to quickly learn what to do. Especially if it\u2019s their first time, they can benefit from your experience and expertise. It also connects you more to your team, which leads to trust, engagement and high performance. #BeConnected\u00a03. Instill a forward-focused vision:Don\u2019t just give employees tasks or projects to complete. Constantly reinforce what the company\u2019s goals are and how their work makes a difference. Empower employees to make decisions in their day-to-day work by helping them think about the company\u2019s\u2014and their own\u2014long-term success. Create a vision, articulate it regularly and share updates on the progress to achieving it. This will allow them to stay committed and focused on accomplishing sustainable growth. #BeRelentless\u00a0As a leader, it\u2019s our responsibility to support our people to reach their full potential. That\u2019s what most positively impacts the overall success of an organization. And most of all, have integrity in every action. #BeTrue\u00a0What are some leadership strategies that work for you?

{"_id": "doc_676", "title": "Going Beyond Your Comfort Zone", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/going-beyond-your-comfort-zone\nGoing Beyond Your Comfort Zone\nShare this\nA favorite quote can speak volumes about a person\u2019s mindset. Rita Saavedra Ortiz, Alorica\u2019s Site Director in Kingston, Jamaica, says that she references this Ralph Waldo Emerson quote often: \u201cDo not go where the path may lead, go instead\nwhere there is no path and leave a trail.\u201d \u00a0 Rita\u2019s personal story certainly fulfills that mantra. She started out as an agent in 2004, moved into quality nine months later, and then switched to operations in 2011. Just a handful of months ago, in January 2018, she moved from Panama to Jamaica\nto take on her newest challenge at the Kingston site. By seizing opportunities as they come, Rita continues to grow and learn in her career, and she inspires others around her to do the same.\nRead her full Q&A below:\nQ: How has working at Alorica specifically led to your personal career growth?A: When I started working in operations seven years ago, I learned the biggest lessons in my career. One of my\nmentors said, if you fail, just learn from your mistakes and move forward. He said to step out of your comfort zone. So, I started out with a small account, and then I moved to a bigger account. I liked it\u2014the exposure with the client, getting\ninto calls with client solutions, making decisions about what is good for the business, and getting to know the financial side. When I had the opportunity to work at this big, new site in Jamaica, I knew I could do it even though it would be new for\nme.\nQ: What motivates you every day?A: I have what I call four baselines that I use every day. The first one is to be myself. The more comfortable you are with yourself, the better you can overcome\nthe roadblocks to succeed. The second one is always be positive. Ninety percent of your day is about how you look at things. The third one is never be afraid to fail. We acquire knowledge from our mistakes, whether good or bad. The fourth one is to\nget to know your people\u2014not only at the professional level, but at the personal level. Talking to people builds loyalty, and that\u2019s how you get people to not work for you, but to work with you.\nQ: If you could change anything in your career trajectory up until now, what would it be and why?A: Sometimes I think, what if I did that different? Those what ifs are part of fear. Every\ndecision I\u2019ve made, good or not so good, they got me where I am right now. I am satisfied with everything I have accomplished. I wouldn\u2019t change anything. When I transitioned from quality to training, I didn\u2019t want to leave, but\nit was a good decision. From there, I got to try new things. There\u2019s so many branches in this business. You\u2019d be surprised about what you might succeed in.\nQ: Can you think of an example when you faced pushback at work because you were female?A: I have never felt that being a woman in this business has been a roadblock. I\u2019ve seen many women\nin this business doing really great things and having opportunities. I always stand up for being a woman in a man\u2019s world. I was a volunteer for the Red Cross in Panama, and I was the first woman to take leadership of a group of rescuers. I\nwas able to stand up and lead that task.\nQ: Do you think it is important to be a mentor?A: Right now, my team is spread all over Panama, and I am still mentoring them. When I see my people growing, being insanely great even when\nwe aren\u2019t together, I feel proud of myself. I am a firm believer in the next line of succession plan. You have to have someone else who can take care of your programs, like a mini me. Mentoring is really important.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc_678", "title": "Seizing the Automation Opportunity: Alorica\u2019s Automated Discovery Process", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/seizing-the-automation-opportunity-alorica-s-automated-discovery-process\nSeizing the Automation Opportunity: Alorica\u2019s Automated Discovery Process\nShare this\nOne of the first stumbling blocks of business process transformation is identifying meaningful automation opportunities. A typical process will have a management consultant, system expert, or Lean Six Sigma specialist to monitor manual processes for a\nset time, collect performance data, and make recommendations. Companies supplement this assessment with executive ideation sessions, operational managers\u2019 workshops, and superuser interviews. The traditional way to speed up and improve the accuracy\nof this approach is to add more consultants over a longer period of time analyzing larger data sets. Yet, despite these efforts, not every process is observed and not all automation opportunities are identified and prioritized.\nIn this blog, I look at how Alorica employs its proprietary tools and algorithms to streamline \u2018the discovery stage\u2019 and recommend effective automation deployment in the front-office.\nFrom manual to automated discovery\nAlorica has developed an automation approach for the discovery stage, calling it \u2018One-Click Automation\u2019. Its unsupervised machine learning algorithms measure agents\u2019 desktop utilization on a select group of 10-20 users. The bot monitors\nthe users\u2019 screen toggle, clicks, data entries and entry type, and tracks time per system and per screen, the time duration for performing each step, and the number of used fields. It counts errors, frequency, variance in the time and data entry\nquality, the end-to-end handling time, the complexity, and importance of the tasks. It also tracks the underlying communication between systems and exchanged information.\nThe bot does not capture personal data or other input information, remaining non-invasive to the systems. It also does not intervene with the users\u2019 actions. Once the bot collects enough information (~100k data points per LOB, typically in two weeks),\nit creates a visual map of the observed processes. The process map visualizes the screens, the start and end points, the navigation between them, and the direction with drill-down functionality. For large product portfolios with multiple support processes\n(for example, in technical support), Alorica requires a bigger user pool to observe.\nAlorica created the discovery bot in its Digital CoE and Innovation Lab (DCOE) in Bengaluru, launched in 2018. The automation specialists in the DCOE analyze the discovery bot results, estimate savings opportunities, and recommend and prioritize bot implementations\nwith workflow business process, exceptions adjudicator, and look-up. Because the collected information shows the actual steps and the specific systems and fields to move the data, the created automation workflows make the bot training quicker and\nmore precise. It also provides cost-benefit analysis and ROI calculation for each automation.\nImplementations for a healthcare client\nFor a U.S. healthcare payer client, Alorica deployed the discovery bots on a statistically relevant number of agent desktops for three days, identifying 150 automation opportunities in multiple processes with tasks such as secondary claims research, multifactor\ncase, clinical guidelines, and Citrix login. The algorithm analyzed the events to measure the number of agents who performed the particular process, its recurrence, and time taken. The team compared the results to the agent training guidelines, then\nAlorica prioritized with the client 11 automation initiatives that delivered the highest time and productivity savings and ROI and CX improvement.\nAlorica ran the discovery bots on both for the client\u2019s voice and non-voice work. For example, in the client\u2019s back-office, the discovery bots analyzes processes for manual data entry from image and PDF claims received over emails and e-fax.\nUsing third-party RPA & AI partner tools, Alorica created bots to capture and auto-populate fields regardless of the screen or source format while blocking certain data or document areas to meet client or compliance requirements such as HIPAA.\nIt also has exception notifications to inform live agents to validate. Another benefit is that these bots runs 24/7. The automation deployed in early 2019 delivered ~70% headcount reduction of the process headcount who translated the data from the\nclaims to the systems.\nThe company is now targeting other existing healthcare clients and showcasing their India DCOE as a \u2018digital workbench\u2019 for back-office processes, leading with automation. For automation opportunities in voice processes, Alorica is working\nwith several travel, retail, BFSI, media and telecom brands.\nAutomation in the process trenches\nThe fundamental challenge of which tasks to automate has many dimensions such as high volume, time-consuming processes, sizable FTE involvement, high error rate, or simply, risk aversion by internal IT teams. To address the latter issue, Alorica automation\ndeployments so far are on its own desktops without compromising, changing or modifying core client systems. The company absorbs the investment cost for running the discovery bots to set up a meaningful discussion with the client\u2019s process owners\non the possible cost-benefit and ROI.\nA less discussed problem with RPA projects is the impermanent state of business processes with dynamic changes of internal rules, product/services, and system environments. The shelf-life of a bot will be quite short and its ROI smaller without human\nsupervisors who in turn need to be prioritized and allocated based on business decisions. The automated desktop analytics model allows the deep learning algorithms to solve at least the first part of the challenge of identifying process impact. To\nmitigate automation program redesigns, Alorica\u2019s solution is to focus on mature system infrastructure with a steady release roadmap.\nAnother challenge to automation is the incentives for the provider. Through the achieved cost optimization and improved performance, Alorica targets a bigger share of the client wallet, looking to take over higher value processes, and switching to performance-based\npricing models. For the above-mentioned healthcare client, Alorica structured the pricing by processed claim, decreasing the overall cost by ~50%.\nThe value of partnering for automation\nWhile broad statements for full automation attract media attention, the reality for most companies is on learning. Automation is not likely to change a process but improve it and increase customer satisfaction. Partnering with an outsourcing provider\ncan deliver faster and better discovery in an ideal scenario, where the vendor has the process and domain expertise and quantitative discovery tools. The next step is to expand automation across both captive and supplier network centers to maximize\nthe benefits.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

Asking Questions and Showing Results", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/the-keys-to-career-development-asking-questions-and-showing-results\nThe Keys to Career Development? Asking Questions and Showing Results\nShare this\nWhen faced with a career opportunity, is your inclination to go for it or to question your qualifications? Having the confidence to put yourself out there, whether you have the exact matching skill set or not, is one of the best learning opportunities\nthere is according to Sharon Leal, Alorica\u2019s Director, Operations based in San Antonio, Texas. \u00a0 Sharon did just that 18 years ago when she took a \u201cleap of faith\u201d and joined the BPO industry--and she hasn\u2019t looked back since. She\u2019s a huge believer in speaking up, asking questions, and helping others achieve career growth.\nRead her full Q&A below:\nQ: How have mentors helped you in your career?A: I\u2019ve always had great mentors. Early in my career, a mentor told me, \u201cdon\u2019t expect what you don\u2019t inspect.\u201d Don\u2019t\nassume everyone will do what they say and to the level you want. Another mentor gave me the advice: \u201clisten to understand.\u201d We sit and we listen, but do we really understand? Ask clarifying questions if you need to so you can lead and\nbe successful.\nQ: Can you share an example of how asking questions helped you to succeed?A: When I got the call back on my application for this company, I asked to speak to someone who was currently in this\nposition, and I spoke to that person for an hour and a half. And when they called me back and offered me the site director position, I asked what training they were going to give me. They sent me to Omaha for 6 weeks. I went through agent training,\nI took calls, I sat with the QA team, I sat with network control and workforce management. I wanted to be set up for success, to have credibility, and relate to the team I was going to manage. You can\u2019t be afraid to ask, and asking isn\u2019t\na weakness.\nQ: Do you think there is still a glass ceiling? Why or why not?A: I was told at my previous job when I got to a director level that I was only promoted because they needed to hire a woman.\nI told them I don\u2019t agree, I have worked really hard, I earned this position, and it wasn\u2019t just given to me. I don\u2019t see this at Alorica. Females can underestimate themselves, and sometimes aren\u2019t confident enough to say,\n\u201cI want to move to the next level.\u201d I\u2019ve never been shy about that. Show your confidence, shake a hand, stand up, and show that you know your business.\nQ: What aspects of the company stand out to you as an employee?A: My goal is to continue to learn everything Alorica has available to us. I\u2019m on the board of directors of MLBA, and I\nlove that we can help employees. I love everything Alorica is doing with social media\u2014that continues to promote our company and shows that they care about their employees. Culture is very important. There are 25 other call centers in San Antonio,\nbut people choose to work for us because we have an environment that people enjoy. \u00a0Q: How do you inspire others to grow in their careers?A: When I am mentoring or working with someone, I find out where they want to go and what they need to do that. You\u2019ve got to have\ngoals, work hard, and not wait on opportunities, even if you\u2019re not an exact match. I\u2019ll do a mock interview with you, and I\u2019ll look at your credentials. Sometimes people want a bachelor\u2019s degree\u2014but, well, I don\u2019t\nhave one! But if you have experience and show your results, you may be the most qualified candidate.

{"_id": "doc_687", "title": "4 Ways to Turn Your Customer\u2019s Experience Into Continuous Improvement", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/4-ways-to-turn-your-customers-experience-into-continuous-improvement\n4 Ways to Turn Your Customer\u2019s Experience Into Continuous Improvement\nShare this\nThe moment when a customer reaches out for support after acquiring a new product or service, is a golden opportunity to drive customer satisfaction AND gather insight at the same time. Four key steps and a little planning can turn this initial customer\nsupport call into continuous improvement and a gift for future innovation.\n1. Know Your Customer\nSegmentation is powerful.\u00a0 When your customers ask for assistance, it\u2019s important to collect the right information so that the customer is assigned to the right segment. Demographic information goes without saying, but focus should also be\ngiven to the\u00a0type\u00a0of customer a person is.\nHow long have they been a customer?How many of your products do they own?How often are they reaching out for support?What past issues have they needed assistance with?Having this insight helps in the way you communicate with the customer later, while also helping you understand how to position self-service and working to find the right solution.\n2. Identify the Problem \u00a0 It may seem simple, but often, companies are not collecting information around\u00a0why the customer is reaching out for help. Knowing the issue\u00a0type\u00a0is critical. Understanding the top customer issues will help you create better\nself-service content, while also providing meaningful information on where product development should focus on driving improvements. In the Forrester article, \u201cInsights-Driven Business Set the Pace for Global Growth\u201d, Forrester\nreferences that insight-driven businesses grow on average 30% more annually than businesses with close-looped learning processes.\u201d1 \u00a0 In an era where information changes so rapidly, the more we leverage what we are learning to make the process better for the customer, the greater opportunity we must drive a better satisfaction level.\n3. Balance Customer Resolution with Customer Effort \u00a0 Resolution is the most critical component as to whether a customer is happy with their support experience. However, it is also necessary to understand the effort the customer had to take to resolve the issue. The more effort required, the more the experience\ndeteriorates. In the recent Alorica eBook,\u00a0Deflecting Call Volume;\u00a0resolution is identified as the largest\ninfluencer of positive customer experience scores. Repeat attempts to resolve issues are not only detrimental to experience scores, but also, they are expensive to support. Therefore, understanding what drives and prevents resolution is a critical\ncomponent of your contact reduction strategy.2 \u00a0 When we think of resolution, we think of it two ways.\nFirst Contact Resolution:\u00a0It\u2019s crucial you understand from the customer whether their issue was resolved the first time. Gathering this information will provide you a tracking mechanism for how well your self-service or\nknowledgebase articles are solving your customer\u2019s issue. This data allows you to pinpoint your opportunities to drive improvement in your self-service content, potentially reducing support calls and driving improvement in customer support.Issue Resolution:\u00a0Issue resolution is a measurement of whether the customer\u2019s issue was resolved. It\u2019s important to understand from the customer what prevented resolution from happening more quickly. This is where\nyou typically gain insight from the customer about being transferred, escalation to a higher level of support, etc. While the customer may now appreciate the fact that their issue is resolved, you will likely see an impact to their overall experience\ngiven the delay in resolution. Remember, resolution and speed of resolution is where you begin to gain customer loyalty.\n4. Build Brand Loyalty \u00a0 One of the best indicators of a customer\u2019s satisfaction level with their support experience is whether they will recommend your brand to others. Collecting this information from the customer after you solve their problem will allow you to better\nunderstand how your support model is impacting or driving the overall customer experience. \u00a0Information is key but listening to your customers and then building a process that allows you to continuously learn will set you apart from others in your industry.\u00a0 In a recent blog by COPC, \u201cThe Value of Listening: How feedback can be an\nopportunity to bring brand image to life,\u201d the author mentions that customers are paying more attention to how a brand responds than ever before.3\u00a0As you better understand your customer segment, how often they call,\nthe types of issues that occur for them, what upsets them and the speed with which\u00a0you can help them, you are armed with information that allows you to drive improvement in the way you service similar customers. When you listen to your customers\nand begin to reduce the effort by the customer and resolve their issues in a timely manner, you reduce the frustration level of the customer and begin to drive brand loyalty and a greater experience for your customers. \u00a0 Competition is everywhere. Issues are going to occur. Building a support model that simplifies the path to your customers\u2019 resolution is important. As you leverage learnings from your customers\u2019 experiences and incorporate those into your\never-changing support model, you begin to reduce the number of support calls required, the length of the call and the effort your customers must spend in getting their issues resolved gets reduced. The cost of your support model will go down and you\nwill gain appreciation and loyalty from your customers as you continue to improve the model to solve their problems. Customers know issues will arise, but the ease and speed in which you solve those issues is what will set you apart from your competition.\nSOURCES\nhttps://www.forrester.com/report/InsightsDriven+Businesses+Set+The+Pace+For+Global+Growth/-/E-RES130848\u201cDeflecting Call Volume,\u201d\u00a0Alorica, 2017,\u00a0https://www.alorica.com/insights/resource/deflecting-call-volume-5-ways-to-drive-calls-out-of-your-call-center.Jezierski, Kathleen, \u201cThe Value of Listening: How feedback can be an opportunity to bring brand image to life,\u201d COPC, May 1, 2017,\u00a0http://www.copc.com/blog/value-listening-brand-image/.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc_688", "title": "6 Reasons Why Millennials Are Better Than Their Stereotype", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/6-reasons-why-millennials-are-better-than-their-stereotype\n6 Reasons Why Millennials Are Better Than Their Stereotype\nShare this\nShaming our youth is a tradition as old as dirt. In recent history Generation X was known as a group of \u201cSlackers.\u201d Before Gen X, the original \u201cME\u201d generation was the \u201cHippies\u201d, the Baby Boomers who are now so worried\nabout these \u201clazy, entitled, narcissistic\u201d Millennials.\nYou can\u2019t understand anyone accurately when you\u2019re judging them\u2026 and that\u2019s exactly what we do when we rely on stereotypes.\nGreg Johnson, Chairman and CEO,\u00a0Damar Services\u00a0said, \u201cI find that it is dangerous to overgeneralize this demographic. We have\nencountered many who are thoughtful, resourceful, open-minded and even visionary community stewards \u2026 Our challenge is to personalize the impact and engage them in ways that engender ownership and investment.\u201d1\u00a0And for\ncontact center operations hungry for a young and tech-savvy workforce, Millennials are now the largest generation in the U.S. labor market\u2014with 56 million now working.2\nRather than putting a whole group of individuals into a stereotype and judging them harshly, get to know them as individuals. You\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised. Who knows? You may even find common ground!\nYou would think that over thousands of years we might have learned to dispel stereotypes. Sadly, we haven\u2019t. This is one \u201cway that it\u2019s always been done\u201d that it\u2019s time to let go of, and here are 6 great reasons why.\n#1. Data doesn\u2019t tell the whole story\nMillennials get a bad rap. And though plenty of people think that they lack a strong work ethic, feel deserving of special treatment and shy away from commitment of any kind, the reality is that they are not that different from the generations that came\nbefore them.3\u00a0While the data we read may be statistically accurate, much of it has nothing to do with social science. Even the content that does come from social science\u2014like the reliable statistics we read about from the Gallup\nOrganization\u2014while accurate, doesn\u2019t tell the context of the Millennial experience.\nWhy? Because these surveys don\u2019t consider the fact that Millennials are going through a new life stage called \u201cemerging adulthood\u201d. According to Haydn\nShaw, generational and cultural differences expert, recognizing that full adulthood begins at age 27 or 28 is important because, \u201cif it\u2019s the Millennials,\nthen it\u2019s a problem that needs to be fixed\u2026if it\u2019s a life stage, it\u2019s a change that we need to understand and adapt to. And understanding that makes working together easier.\u201d\n#2. Millennials work to live, not live to work\nMillennials place a higher premium on the success of their personal lives\u2014even above their careers.\u00a0According to Darlene Corbett, a therapist and success coach, \u201clike many generations before Millennials, marriage and family are part of\nthe big picture for the Millennial population.4\nBut there is more to this story. They want to spend time with their families\u00a0and\u00a0fulfill career aspirations. If companies want to tap the loyalty and the career aspirations of this generation for leadership development,\nthey should create a work environment that respects personal values, especially related to family.\nFind ways to demonstrate that you care about the success of their family life and empower them to build a great career without damaging their personal relationships.\n#3. Millennials desire personal growth\nWork-life balance is important to Millennials; they want to work for companies who prioritize the things that matter most to them\u2014such as health, family and leisure time.5\nMillennials are looking for job opportunities where they can learn and grow. They crave continuous feedback and coaching and that\u2019s a good thing! Instead of viewing it as a chore, capitalize on the opportunity to mentor them.\nGen Y is attracted to leaders who clearly articulate the WHY, the purpose behind how work gets done every day. They are looking for coaches who will champion them, encourage them, inspire and motivate them, and challenge them to greatness.\nCompanies have more and more knowledge and skill leaving the workforce and a whole bunch of young fresh workers who want to grow. Why not pair them up and be intentional about having those with expertise invest in those who need and desperately want to\ngrow? Sounds like a win-win.\n#4.\u00a0Millennials live their ideals\nAccording to Jean Case, Founder and CEO of The Case Foundation, Millennials invest in the things they care about. A 2017 Millennials Report indicates that Millennials are even more invested in philanthropy than in previous years, and put an emphasis on\nCSR in the workplace.6\nA common adage in leadership is to \u201cwalk the talk\u201d. Well, Millennials are doing just that! They are setting a great example. Cheer them on, or better yet, follow suit.\nRecognize that their genuineness will build a whole new generation of leaders in the workforce that leads by example. That is sorely needed in this age where distrust of leadership can wreak havoc in organizations.\n#5. Millennials number 73 million\nMillennials are projected to overtake Boomers as America\u2019s largest generation in 2019, with 73 million individuals. In fact, as of 2017, Millennials were already the largest population in the workforce\u2014with 56 million working or looking for\nwork.\n7\n#6.\u00a0Millennials are the future (like it or not)\nAs Padraig Cotter points out \u201cMillennials are redesigning the future of work. They\u2019re digital natives and it\u2019s no longer a case of employees adjusting to their work; it\u2019s about\u00a0 the work adjusting to them. New ways of thinking\nare crucial, and Millennials can provide this.\u201d8\nOftentimes, fear holds us back \u2013 fear of the unknown, fear of change or just blind fear. But there\u2019s a whole generation of young people brimming with talent and yearning for a chance to make their mark on the world. Let\u2019s not succumb\nto fear and judgment just because we don\u2019t know or understand them.\nMillennials and contact centers are a perfect match. Get behind Millennials, invest in them, and support them as they take you to places you\u2019ve never gone before! Read the proven ways to recruit and retain this valuable and qualified workforce in\nAlorica\u2019s\u00a0Decoding Millennials\u00a0eBook.\nHere at Alorica, we\u2019re looking forward to the adventure.

{"_id": "doc_690", "title": "Utility Industry Looks to Omnichannel Support", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/utility-industry-looks-to-omnichannel-support\nUtility Industry Looks to Omnichannel Support\nShare this\nIt all started in the 1990s. Ongoing legislative changes in the utility sector have produced a gradual shift on the pricing and delivery of electricity from strict government regulation to the impact of market forces. Natural gas and green solutions like solar and wind power have also come under review. Non-utilities now have direct retail access to residential consumers in 18 jurisdictions throughout the U.S. and Canada, representing more than\u00a039 million residential accounts1.\u00a0Of those,\u00a044 percent receive services2\u00a0from a retail energy provider (REP), as of year-end 2014.\nAlthough the legislative environment is still very much in flux, utility companies increasingly recognize the need to restructure their approach to service delivery and customer support as with any consumer product or service, new technologies and an increasingly emboldened user base demand greater attention to the consumer relationship.\nIn this highly controlled industry, demand from utility providers, REPs and consumers to provide more immediate and flexible options for customer care has placed pressure on regulators to redefine interaction with consumers. Currently, Utilities and Energy Suppliers must adhere to strict protocols related to communication\u2014specifically these protocols dictate the frequency and channels through which issues related to service and payments can be conducted.\u00ad\u00ad As a result, many companies have moved to un-silo their Care and First Party collections teams and combine them to form a more cohesive and unified operation for three key reasons: Consistency, Focus on Customer Experience, and Improved Revenue Recovery.\nAlorica, a contact center outsourcing leader in the Energy Utility sector, has introduced Financial Care (through its subsidiary, EGS Financial Care, Inc.) to help meet the growing shift in the service mix in the industry that focuses on Care, First Party Collection and Omnichannel flexibility. These services help Utilities bridge the gap between regulators and the millennial generation, who prefer Web-based self-service options and appreciate the sense of empowerment that comes from different delivery models (such as prepaid energy).\nAs they consider how to better support the stakeholders at all levels, utility regulators and electricity providers should consider the following market trends:\nConsumers are increasingly mobile.Smartphone technology and cloud-based systems have made it possible for people to manage their utilities anywhere, anytime \u2013 everything from turning devices on and off, to re-programming their thermostat settings, to making a payment. And as technology continues to advance, consumers will look for further innovation from utility providers related to mobile platforms.\nConsumers want more control over costs.The idea of prepaid electric service \u2013 based on previous consumption rates \u2013 has already gained traction with consumers who are now seeing energy savings between 5.5 and 14 percent3.\u00a0However, this model brings with it new challenges; specifically, protecting customers who may underestimate their usage, particularly because\u00a0utility companies have more leeway in terms of shutting off service4.\nSmart meters mean more programs.\u00a0Smart meters, which measure energy usage in increments as small as every 15 minutes, have opened up opportunities for time-based rate programs. Rather than being billed based on flat or tiered rates,\u00a0consumers can benefit5\u00a0from the variability over time in the cost to produce electricity and see a cost saving through dynamic rates.\u00a0Energy companies potentially can capture a greater market share if they can explain the pricing models effectively and provide tools for customers to self-check meter readings.\nNew developments in technology, combined with the removal of barriers to entry for retail choices, means that utility providers must address changing consumer preferences, or be left behind with antiquated systems and processes. From innovative pricing models and payment plans to self-service options and mobile-friendly tools, electric companies that take an omnichannel approach to customer care and support have the opportunity to effectively differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive market and foster further positive change for the industry as a whole.\nWhen you consider this dramatic industry shift and the cost and timing associated with implementing change, many utilities and energy marketers are beginning to shift responsibility and accountability to outsourced customer contact center relationships. Companies like Alorica have the depth of experience, resources and PCI-compliant technology to seamlessly extend the existing platforms and capabilities within the in-house Utility contact center while blending omnichannel solutions\u2014eliminating significant capital expense, time delay and HR challenges.\nThrough outsourcing, Utilities are introducing new services today that are strengthening customer experience and satisfaction ratings. Talk about a brighter outlook for everyone.\nSOURCES\n1 \u00a0http://defgllc.com/publication/abaccus-2015-annual-baseline-assessment-of-choice-in-canada-and-the-united-states/\n2 \u00a0http://defgllc.com/publication/abaccus-2015-annual-baseline-assessment-of-choice-in-canada-and-the-united-states/\n3 \u00a0http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2014/06/140604-pre-paid-electricity-billing-plans-help-or-hurt-consumers/\n4 \u00a0http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2014/06/140604-pre-paid-electricity-billing-plans-help-or-hurt-consumers/\n5 \u00a0https://www.smartgrid.gov/recovery_act/time_based_rate_programs.html\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc_693", "title": "Level Up Gamer Loyalty in a Digital-First Experience Economy", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/level-up-gamer-loyalty-in-digital-first-experience-economy\nLevel Up Gamer Loyalty in a Digital-First Experience Economy\nShare this\nThere are many ingredients a video game company can draw on to generate sustainable user growth. From discounts & online events to patches and expansion packs, game developers, publishers, and the cloud platform providers leverage all sorts of campaigns\nthat entice players to stay plugged in and eager to invite friends and family to join the fun. One underappreciated element that gaming companies can tap into for community building\u2014and brand loyalty\u2014is customer support, which has taken\non greater importance in the past year due to the huge influx of new gamers.\nThe current gaming boom is not exactly unique. The industry has seen explosive\ngrowth in the past, with eight generations of consoles recruiting a whole new crop\nof hardcore and casual gamers. The difference this time around is that the latest surge coincides with the ascent of the digital-first experience economy. The modern-day gamer has grown accustomed to the conveniences provided by app-based food delivery\nordering and the chance to ask a brand a question about a product over direct messaging on social media. They assume their bank, grocer, retailer, streamer, and game provider can and should do the same. As a result, a comprehensive player support\nstrategy today must embrace the following objectives to ensure a resilient and profitable customer experience (CX) operation.\nAll-Inclusive Player Support\nThe gaming industry is not exactly a stranger to customer support. Since the advent of the internet, video game companies have had to resolve issues that revolve around account management, tech support, and everything in between. The gaming craze that\ntook shape in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic only exacerbated the need for quality customer service, as lengthier queues and denser contacts became the norm in many cases. The broad range of services a modern CX team is required to offer grew\nby the day. The baseline now seems to comprise the basics, such as account management & payment processing, plus community moderation, knowledge management expansion, live events support, and protecting gamers against fraud.\nThen there is the scale. The gaming community touches all corners of the globe, so video game companies must be able to support an international audience that speaks a wide set of languages across every time zone. Even better, support agents should have\nthe regional know-how to allow companies to truly localize their products in every market. With global gaming revenue exceeding $180 billion and no signs of slowing down, gaming companies need to adopt robust CX services now or risk losing players\nto the companies that do.\nBuilding Loyalty Outside the Game\nRegardless of industry, market data consistently demonstrates that positive customer experiences are a major competitive differentiator. The challenge is that customer experiences in 2021 look a lot different than they did a decade ago. For starters, consumers have dramatically changed the way they communicate\nwith one another. Millennials and Generation Z have jumpstarted this shift. These digital natives overwhelmingly prefer to communicate via digital messaging tools as opposed to traditional channels \u2013 and this appears to apply whether they are engaging their best friends or their favorite brands. Overall, the younger generations are more comfortable with digital channels, whether they are powered by humans or bots.\nIt also follows the logic that Generation Z is more open to using AI-powered chatbots because\nthey have experience with AI applications from the games they grew up with. Deploying virtual assistants makes it easier for tech-savvy consumers to engage brands while supplying contact centers the extra bandwidth to resolve any number of issues.\nThe point is to give consumers choice. Introducing omnichannel functionality through voice and text-based capabilities enables support teams to meet players through their favorite channels, creating positive impressions in the process. The number\none goal of every developer and publisher should be that players are spending their time on game play and not support issues.\nCultivating Trust and Safety\nAs gaming companies continue to develop multiple revenue streams, the risk and volume of fraud, not to mention account abuse, are sure to increase. The average player today is more likely to engage brands outside the game, whether that\u2019s consuming\nYouTube reviews, Twitch live streams, podcast recordings, message boards, and the targeted journalism devoted to gaming. The abundance of media today has seeped into the mainstream, exposing players to content that was traditionally only seen or heard\nby the most serious of fans. And with consumers having a heightened awareness of privacy and security, video game companies must protect players efficiently and responsively from fraud across all channels.\nCompanies that provide reliable, safe environments are more likely to realize player community growth.\u00a0 As consumer behavior and expectations change, so too must player support. As much as game developers, publishers, and cloud platforms prioritize\ndeveloping the coolest, most popular games, they also need to place emphasis on offering a modern, comprehensive customer journey that makes it easy for players to simply focus on playing their next game.

Already valued at $50B in 2019, the global telehealth market is expected to reach $460B by 2030.1It\u2019s here to stay. Telehealth services are more accessible\u2014especially in the wake of COVID-19. In the U.S., the passage of the Advancing Telehealth Beyond COVID-19 Act of 2022 makes it even more accessible, allowing\nMedicare recipients to access telehealth services through 2024.\u00a0\u00a0Older patients rely on it. Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 43% of adults aged 65+ use telehealth services for everything from general everyday needs like diagnosing and treating common colds and flus and\nfollow-up visits to managing chronic conditions, more than any other age group. And considering that America\u2019s 65+ population is projected to nearly double over the next 30 years2 \u2014from $48M to $88M by 2050\u2014that\u2019s a whole lot of users!\u00a0It\u2019s key to market positioning. With the age of online medicine and distributed care in full swing, healthcare systems are competing with retail clinics, big tech, digital healthtech startups, and payers. And considering that 60% of consumers expect their digital healthcare experiences to mirror retail3 and feel that just one bad experience is too many4 , only companies who deliver consistently great CX are poised to come out on top.\u00a0\u00a0Specialties are continually expanding into it.

To her, being a mentor is an integral part\nof her daily life. You know the concept of \u201cpaying it forward\u201d? Well, that describes Albertha to the T. \u00a0 Even though you could say that Albertha fell into the training and development field, it\u2019s no accident that led her to her current role as VP, Operations Training at Alorica. She\u2019s someone who truly enjoys\nteaching people and seeing them succeed. \u00a0Read her full Q&A below:Q: What was your strategy for reaching an executive level position in your career?A: My strategy has been to always keep in touch with the company\u2019s goals and initiatives.\nIf we\u2019re not aligned, we\u2019re not anything. I learned years ago that the purpose of training is to achieve a business result, and you can only achieve that when you know the goals. I\u2019ve done this throughout my career. \u00a0Q: Did you ever work with a mentor, and how did that process help you? A: I like to say that I\u2019ve had many mentors, even though they may not have known. If I see someone who has\na talent, trait or skill that I admire, I\u2019m going to get to know them. I will insert myself in their space and ask them to teach me. As you supervise people, you should be their teacher and guide. If I know something, I\u2019m going to share\nit with you and my team. There\u2019s no value in holding back information. The more we all know, the more we can be successful together. \u00a0Q: Can you think of an example when you faced pushback at work because you were female? How did you face that challenge?A: As I look at challenges that I\u2019ve had, I try to not\nlook at it from the perspective of, \u201care you challenging me because I\u2019m a female or a different race?\u201d What I do is if someone is challenging me, or doesn\u2019t want to work with me, I find out why. You\u2019re going to work with\nall different types of people with different ideologies about a lot of different things. What are you going to do? You have to work through each issue.\nQ: How has working at Alorica specifically led to your personal career growth?A: At Alorica, this Women\u2019s Initiative is very exciting. It\u2019s wonderful that the company has\ntaken this opportunity to say we need to do more, we need to help to educate and grow our female work force. In my area, I find the training field exciting. Even though I fell into this position, it was definitely a great fit for me. It fit my natural\ntendencies which is to want to see people succeed. In training, you get the satisfaction of seeing someone on the operations floor being successful. I love investing in each person.\nQ: How important is it to have a career plan? How often do you outline your personal career goals?A: I look at where I am, generally in December or January. I\u2019m a linear person,\nand I do things in a timeline. I look back at the goals I made last year. Did I meet them, how close did I get, and should I realign them? I do checks along the way to make sure I\u2019m on track throughout the year. There are times when life happens,\npersonal life or changes in the company that can bump you off course. Then, you have to look at your original goal and ask if that\u2019s the right one to have. A goal is just that\u2014it\u2019s a point of direction, but you have to be flexible\nenough to take detours.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

At Alorica, our approach to protecting the planet as part of our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Environmental, Social &\nGovernance (ESG) is no different than how we advance our philanthropic and people-centered programs\u2014we stay connected with the needs and interests of our employees and then we empower each other to make a difference where it matters\nmost. The key is to get started from wherever you can in as many different ways as possible!\u00a0As a large employer in the people business, it\u2019s important that Alorica leads initiatives to positively impact the countries in which we operate. We focus on maintaining sustainable operations across our large-scale contact centers, whether it\u2019s\nby partnering with vendors that are sustainability experts in managing and recycling waste or making environmentally conscious changes to our offices.\u00a0A few examples:Transition to LED lights and energy-efficient HVAC systems Implementation of a GREENGUARD-certified Healthy High-Performance Cleaning (HHPC) program to use green, earth-friendly cleaning productsENERGY STAR certification by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at our sites (and counting!), meaning that these buildings use less energy and cause fewer greenhouse gas emissions than their peersSignificant reduction of our carbon footprint by cutting down employees\u2019 commute and usage of environment-impacting office protocols through our work-at-home program\u2014Alorica AnywhereTracking and reporting of our ESG efforts through participation in the annual Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), which enables us to achieve our sustainability goals and align closely with our clients\u2019 objectives\u00a0But there\u2019s something else businesses can do. What we\u2019ve learned at Alorica is that educating and encouraging our 115,000+ employees to also do their part makes a huge difference. Our people are passionate and they make things happen! Last\nyear, we had nearly 44,000 employees complete our annual Sustainability Survey! Out of these participants\u202681% of Aloricans shared that they commuted to work sustainably (biking, walking, carpooling)86% used energy-efficient light bulbs90% of employees consciously didn\u2019t print (paper) regularly for work \u00a0Not only that, but our employees chose eco-friendly projects as their teambuilding activities and as part of our 2022 Passion for the Planet contest, which led to 1,588 trees being planted and 188,000 pounds of material being recycled. We\ncontinue to measure and recognize these initiatives as well as share tips and key facts to remind our workforce that every environment-focused action counts.\u00a0So, let\u2019s continue to be intentional together. Whether it\u2019s using your own reusable water bottle, turning off lights and water when not in use, or being conscious of how much plastic/packaging is being used when you shop\u2014our efforts\nmatter. Remember, Earth is all we have. There is no Plan(et) B.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.
